      question: "Does VibeFlow write the code for my app?",
      answer: "No, VibeFlow is not an automatic code generation tool that builds your entire application. Instead, it focuses on the crucial early stages of idea refinement, resource discovery, and planning. It provides you with insights, data suggestions, and learning pathways to empower *you* to build your app with a clearer vision and stronger foundation. It might offer small, illustrative code snippets for API usage in the future."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of datasets and APIs can VibeFlow find?",
      answer: "VibeFlow searches through a curated collection of publicly available datasets and API information. This includes data from various domains like government, finance, social media trends, public utilities, and more. The goal is to help you find existing data and services that could be leveraged for your application."
    },
    {
      question: "Why am I not finding many resources for my specific app idea?",
      answer: "VibeFlow is currently a proof-of-concept, and our curated collection of datasets and APIs is actively growing. While we aim to provide relevant suggestions, our database is not yet exhaustive. If you don't find specific resources for a niche idea, it might be because it's outside our current curated set. We're continuously adding more resources to improve coverage. VibeFlow's main goal at this stage is to demonstrate the power of AI and vector search in discovering and refining app ideas based on available data."
    },
    {
      question: "Is VibeFlow free to use?",
      answer: "Yes, VibeFlow is currently free to use during this phase."
    },
    {
      question: "Who built VibeFlow?",
      answer: "VibeFlow was developed by Grace Esteban (Vibecoder Extraordinaire) and Duane Snider (The Quintessential Geek from San Francisco, California) as an entry for the MongoDB & Google Cloud AI in Action Challenge, with significant assistance from Google's Gemini AI."

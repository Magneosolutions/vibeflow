# Tech Context: VibeFlow

## Core Technologies
The VibeFlow platform, as an **Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool**, will rely on a combination of modern technologies, prioritizing scalability, ease of integration, and an interactive user experience.

1.  **Frontend (VibeFlow Platform):**
    *   **Framework: React**
        *   *Reasoning:* Chosen for its rich ecosystem, performance, component-based architecture, strong community support, and suitability for building dynamic and highly interactive UIs necessary for vibe exploration and refinement.
    *   **Language:** TypeScript (preferred for type safety and maintainability).
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (already implemented).

2.  **Backend (VibeFlow Platform):**
    *   **Framework: Node.js with Express.js**
        *   *Reasoning:* Chosen for its performance, strong ecosystem, ease of integration with Google Gemini SDK and MongoDB drivers, and suitability for building scalable APIs. TypeScript is used for type safety and maintainability.
    *   **Language: TypeScript** (transpiled to JavaScript).
    *   **API Specification:** OpenAPI (Swagger) for clear API documentation and contract.
    *   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing APIs and managing user sessions. Consideration for OAuth 2.0 if third-party logins are desired in the future.

3.  **Database (VibeFlow Platform):**
    *   **MongoDB Atlas:**
        *   Primary data store for curated collections: public datasets, API metadata, learning resources, and (future) open-source components/patterns.
        *   **Atlas Vector Search:** Core for semantic matching of user "vibes" to these curated resources.
        *   **Atlas Search:** For keyword-based filtering and faceted search across curated collections.
        *   VibeFlow will **not** be provisioning MongoDB clusters for users in this model.

4.  **AI & Machine Learning:**
    *   **Google Gemini API (or similar LLM):**
        *   Natural Language Processing (NLP): To understand user input, extract entities, and discern intent.
        *   Vector Embedding Generation: To convert user "vibes" and resource descriptions into vectors for semantic search.
        *   **Insight & Feedback Generation:** To provide the "Vibe Check," suggest data usage, explain resource relevance, and facilitate "what if" scenario analysis.
        *   **(Limited) Code Snippet Generation:** Potentially for illustrating API usage or simple data interaction examples, not full-scale codebase generation.
    *   *Considerations:* Model capabilities for nuanced feedback and explanation, API limits, cost, ease of integration.

5.  **Cloud Platform (VibeFlow Platform):**
    *   **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**
        *   **Google Cloud Run:** For deploying and hosting the VibeFlow backend and frontend services. Chosen for its simplicity, scalability, and pay-per-use model.
        *   **Google Cloud Identity Platform:** Chosen for managing user authentication.
            *   *Reasoning:* Provides robust, secure, and scalable identity management.
        *   (Potentially other Google APIs if relevant for direct integration into VibeFlow's analysis or as examples, e.g., Natural Language API for deeper text analysis).
        *   VibeFlow will **not** be using Google Cloud Build to deploy user applications in this model.

6.  **Version Control & CI/CD (VibeFlow Platform):**
    *   **GitHub:** For VibeFlow's own codebase.
    *   **Google Cloud Build:** For VibeFlow's own CI/CD pipeline, deploying the platform to Cloud Run.
    *   VibeFlow will **not** be interacting with user GitHub repositories or managing their CI/CD in this model.

## Development Setup & Environment
*   **Local Development:**
    *   Node.js/npm or Python/pip for backend development.
    *   Docker and Docker Compose for containerizing services locally, mimicking the cloud environment.
    *   MongoDB Community Server or a local Docker instance of MongoDB for development against the database.
    *   Access to cloud service emulators if available (e.g., for Cloud Run, Cloud Build).
*   **IDE:** VS Code is recommended with relevant extensions for JavaScript/TypeScript/Python, Docker, etc.
*   **Configuration Management:** `.env` files for managing API keys, connection strings, and other sensitive information. These should be gitignored.

## Technical Constraints & Considerations
*   **API Rate Limits:** Interactions with external APIs (AI models, GitHub, GCP, MongoDB Atlas) will be subject to rate limits. Implement appropriate error handling, retries, and potentially queuing mechanisms.
*   **Cost Management:**
    *   Monitor API usage for AI services (Gemini) and cloud services (Cloud Run, MongoDB Atlas) to manage costs for the VibeFlow platform itself.
*   **Security:**
    *   Securely manage API keys and credentials for VibeFlow's own services.
    *   Validate all user inputs.
    *   Rely on Google Cloud Identity Platform for secure user authentication.
    *   Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.).
    *   Protect user data and PII (e.g., user vibes, saved preferences).
*   **Scalability:** Design backend services (Vibe Analysis & Feedback, Resource Discovery) to be scalable. MongoDB Atlas and Cloud Run are inherently scalable. Authentication service must also be scalable.
*   **AI Insight Quality:** The utility of VibeFlow will heavily depend on the quality, relevance, and actionability of the AI-generated feedback, resource suggestions, and learning pathways. This requires careful prompt engineering.
*   **Resource Curation:** The quality, breadth, and up-to-dateness of the curated datasets, API information, and learning resources in MongoDB will significantly impact the value proposition. This requires an ongoing effort.

## Dependencies (High-Level)
*   **VibeFlow Platform:**
    *   MongoDB Node.js/Python Driver
    *   Google Cloud SDK/Client Libraries (for Cloud Run, Identity Platform, AI APIs)
    *   Chosen frontend (React) and backend frameworks.
    *   (No GitHub API client library needed for user repos in this model).

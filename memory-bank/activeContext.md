# Active Context: VibeFlow

## Current Work Focus
*   **Backend Project Setup (Node.js/Express with TypeScript):**
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend` directory, initialized `npm`, installed dependencies (Express, MongoDB, Gemini SDK, etc.) and dev dependencies (TypeScript, nodemon, types).
    *   Configured `tsconfig.json`, basic project structure (`src`, `.gitignore`, `.env`).
    *   Implemented basic Express server in `src/index.ts` and added `package.json` scripts.
*   **Real Authentication Implementation (Firebase/GCIP):** Complete and reportedly working.
*   **Dataset Curation (MongoDB):** First dataset ("Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)") successfully inserted.
*   **Strategic Shift & Documentation:** Core concept ("Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool") and all Memory Bank documents are up-to-date.
*   **UI & Frontend Foundation Stable.**
*   **Version Control Up-to-Date (Locally):** All changes, including backend setup, are documented and will be committed shortly.
*   **Cloud Run Deployment Stable (Frontend).**

## Recent Changes
*   **Set up Initial Backend Project (Node.js/Express with TypeScript):**
    *   Created directory, initialized npm, installed dependencies.
    *   Configured `tsconfig.json`, project structure, `.gitignore`, `.env`.
    *   Added basic Express server and `package.json` scripts.
*   **Integrated Firebase Authentication:**
    *   Installed Firebase SDK.
    *   Created `firebaseConfig.ts` with project credentials.
    *   Rewrote `AuthContext.tsx` to use Firebase.
    *   Updated `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `App.tsx` for Firebase integration.
*   **Initial Dataset Curation:**
    *   Defined schema for `datasets` collection in MongoDB.
    *   Guided user to insert the "Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)" dataset document into `vibeflow_db.datasets` via VS Code playground. Confirmed successful insertion.
*   **Memory Bank Updates (Strategic Shift & Diagram Rename):**
    *   Updated all core memory bank files and `.clinerules` for strategic shift and diagram rename.
*   **Updated `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx`:** Added new introductory text.
*   **Navigation Fixes:** Ensured `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` correctly navigate after auth.
*   **Strategic Redirection Brainstorming:** Shifted VibeFlow's focus.
*   **Resolved UI Update for `Layout.tsx`:** New Tailwind styles and animations for `Layout.tsx` are correctly applying in Cloud Run.
*   **Committed and Pushed Previous Changes:** UI fixes, strategic shift memory bank updates, and prior changes were pushed to GitHub.
*   **Successfully Deployed `vibeflow-frontend` to Cloud Run and Made Public.**
*   **Configured `vibeflow-frontend` for Cloud Run CI/CD (initial setup).**

## Next Steps
1.  **Commit & Push All Recent Changes:** Commit backend setup and associated memory bank updates to GitHub.
2.  **Backend Development (Core VibeFlow Logic):**
    *   Implement MongoDB connection in `vibeflow-backend/src/services/mongoService.ts`.
    *   Implement AI interaction (embedding generation, insights) in `vibeflow-backend/src/services/aiService.ts`.
    *   Develop the `/api/process-vibe` endpoint in `vibeflow-backend/src/routes/vibeRoutes.ts`.
    *   Connect the frontend "Flow" button to this new backend endpoint.
3.  **Thoroughly Test Real Authentication:** (User confirmed this is working).

## Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **Backend Technology Stack:** Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript (Decision made and initial project setup complete).
*   **Real Authentication Implemented & Working:** Firebase/GCIP is the live authentication system.
*   **Initial Dataset Inserted:** One dataset is in MongoDB.
*   **Core Product Direction: Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool** (Decision Made. Fully rolled out).
*   **Frontend Framework: React** (Decision Made and Implemented).
*   **Authentication Provider: Google Cloud Identity Platform** (Implementation complete and working).
*   **AI Model Selection:** Pending (e.g., Google Gemini - API key is in backend `.env` but integration not built).
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md`. The diagram in `systemPatterns.md` (which `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` now mirrors) is the current source of truth for system flow.
*   **Prioritization:** Commit current Memory Bank updates. Then, decide on next focus (more curation, API schema, or auth/backend).

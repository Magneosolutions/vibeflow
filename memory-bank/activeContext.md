# Active Context: VibeFlow

## Current Work Focus
*   **Backend Services & API Implementation (Initial):**
    *   `mongoService.ts`: Implemented MongoDB connection logic.
    *   `aiService.ts`: Implemented Gemini connection and `getTextEmbedding` function.
    *   `vibeRoutes.ts`: Created `/api/process-vibe` endpoint (with simulated DB search).
    *   `index.ts`: Integrated routes, error handling, and DB connection on startup.
*   **Frontend-Backend Connection:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx`: "Flow" button now calls `/api/process-vibe` and displays results/loading/errors.
*   **UI Branding Update:**
    *   Updated `index.html` favicon and title.
    *   Added `VibeFlow.png` logo to `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `MainAppPage.tsx`.
*   **Backend Project Setup (Node.js/Express with TypeScript):** Complete.
*   **Real Authentication Implementation (Firebase/GCIP):** Complete and working.
*   **Dataset Curation (MongoDB):** First dataset inserted.
*   **Strategic Shift & Documentation:** All Memory Bank documents are up-to-date.
*   **UI & Frontend Foundation Stable.**
*   **Version Control Up-to-Date (Locally):** All changes, including backend service/API implementation, are documented and will be committed shortly.
*   **Cloud Run Deployment Stable (Frontend).**

## Recent Changes
*   **Implemented Initial Backend Logic:**
    *   Developed `mongoService.ts` for DB connection.
    *   Developed `aiService.ts` for Gemini embedding.
    *   Developed `vibeRoutes.ts` with `/api/process-vibe` endpoint.
    *   Updated `index.ts` to use routes and connect DB.
*   **Connected Frontend to Backend:** Updated `MainAppPage.tsx` to call the new API endpoint.
*   **UI Branding:** Updated favicon, title, and added VibeFlow logo to auth pages and main app page.
*   **Set up Initial Backend Project (Node.js/Express with TypeScript):** Completed.
*   **Integrated Firebase Authentication:**
    *   Installed Firebase SDK.
    *   Created `firebaseConfig.ts` with project credentials.
    *   Rewrote `AuthContext.tsx` to use Firebase.
    *   Updated `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `App.tsx` for Firebase integration.
*   **Initial Dataset Curation:**
    *   Defined schema for `datasets` collection in MongoDB.
    *   Guided user to insert the "Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)" dataset document into `vibeflow_db.datasets` via VS Code playground. Confirmed successful insertion.
*   **Memory Bank Updates (Strategic Shift & Diagram Rename):**
    *   Updated all core memory bank files and `.clinerules` for strategic shift and diagram rename.
*   **Updated `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx`:** Added new introductory text.
*   **Navigation Fixes:** Ensured `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` correctly navigate after auth.
*   **Strategic Redirection Brainstorming:** Shifted VibeFlow's focus.
*   **Resolved UI Update for `Layout.tsx`:** New Tailwind styles and animations for `Layout.tsx` are correctly applying in Cloud Run.
*   **Committed and Pushed Previous Changes:** UI fixes, strategic shift memory bank updates, and prior changes were pushed to GitHub.
*   **Successfully Deployed `vibeflow-frontend` to Cloud Run and Made Public.**
*   **Configured `vibeflow-frontend` for Cloud Run CI/CD (initial setup).**

## Next Steps
1.  **Commit & Push All Recent Changes:** Commit backend service/API implementation, frontend connection, and associated memory bank updates to GitHub.
2.  **Backend - Implement Real Vector Search:**
    *   Generate and store actual embedding for the "Google Trends" dataset in MongoDB (using `aiService.getTextEmbedding` and manual update or a script).
    *   Create Atlas Vector Search index on `datasets.description_embedding`.
    *   Implement the `$vectorSearch` aggregation in `vibeRoutes.ts`, replacing the simulation.
3.  **Thoroughly Test End-to-End Flow:** From vibe input on frontend to (simulated then real) search results.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **Backend Services (Initial):** `mongoService`, `aiService` (embedding), and `/api/process-vibe` route are implemented.
*   **Frontend Connected to Backend:** `MainAppPage.tsx` calls the API.
*   **Backend Technology Stack:** Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript (Setup complete, initial services built).
*   **Real Authentication Implemented & Working:** Firebase/GCIP is the live authentication system.
*   **Initial Dataset Inserted:** One dataset is in MongoDB (still needs its `description_embedding` populated with a real vector).
*   **Core Product Direction: Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool** (Decision Made. Fully rolled out).
*   **Frontend Framework: React** (Decision Made and Implemented).
*   **Authentication Provider: Google Cloud Identity Platform** (Implementation complete and working).
*   **AI Model Selection:** Pending (e.g., Google Gemini - API key is in backend `.env` but integration not built).
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md`. The diagram in `systemPatterns.md` (which `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` now mirrors) is the current source of truth for system flow.
*   **Prioritization:** Commit current Memory Bank updates. Then, decide on next focus (more curation, API schema, or auth/backend).

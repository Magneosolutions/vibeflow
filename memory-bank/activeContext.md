# Active Context: VibeFlow

## Current Work Focus
*   **API Resource Discovery Feature Verified:**
    *   Successfully populated `apis` collection in MongoDB.
    *   Verified Atlas Vector Search index for `apis`.
    *   User successfully redeployed `vibeflow-backend` with latest code.
    *   `curl` test confirmed `apiResults` present in backend response.
    *   UI test confirmed "Suggested APIs" (including Google Maps API) are displayed correctly.
    *   End-to-end API search and display functionality is now working.
*   **Monitoring and Planning Next Steps:** Reviewing remaining tasks from `progress.md`.
*   **UI Branding Update:** (No recent changes, keeping for context)
    *   Updated `index.html` favicon and title.
    *   Added `VibeFlow.png` logo to `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `MainAppPage.tsx`.
*   **Backend Project Setup (Node.js/Express with TypeScript):** Complete.
*   **Real Authentication Implementation (Firebase/GCIP):** Complete and working.
*   **Dataset Curation (MongoDB):** Initial datasets and "App Ideas" for playground inserted.
*   **UI & Frontend Foundation Stable.**
*   **Cloud Run Deployment Stable (Frontend).**
    *   Note: A previous mobile API call issue from frontend is still pending investigation, potentially related to backend or CORS.
    *   Note: A previous frontend login navigation issue was observed and deferred.
*   **Real Vector Search Implemented & Tested (Datasets):**
    *   Script created and run to populate `description_embedding` for the "Google Trends" dataset.
    *   Atlas Vector Search index `vector_index_datasets_description` created on `datasets.description_embedding`.
    *   `vibeRoutes.ts` updated to use real `$vectorSearch` aggregation.
    *   End-to-end flow tested successfully: vibe input -> embedding -> vector search -> results (including score and sample data snippet) displayed on frontend.
*   **Frontend Enhanced to Display Score and Sample Data:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to render the `score` and `sample_data_snippet` for matched datasets.
*   **Curated "App Ideas & Features" Dataset for Playground:**
    *   Defined and scripted the insertion of 3 sample "App Ideas & Features" documents into the `datasets` collection.
    *   Each new document includes a generated `description_embedding`.
    *   Confirmed these new app ideas are discoverable via vector search and display correctly on the frontend.
*   **Frontend: Added "Try in Playground" Button UI:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to display a "Try in Playground" button for datasets categorized as "Playground App Idea".
    *   Corrected `vibeRoutes.ts` to ensure the `category` field is projected to the frontend.
*   **Implemented Dataset Playground Functionality (End-to-End):**
    *   **AI Service:** `aiService.ts` updated with `generateSampleMongoQueries` function using the chat model.
    *   **Backend Routes:** Created `playgroundRoutes.ts` with endpoints for generating sample queries (`/generate-queries`) and executing them (`/execute-query`). Integrated into `index.ts`.
    *   **Frontend Logic:** `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to fetch sample queries when "Try in Playground" is clicked, display them as buttons, and then fetch and display results when a sample query button is clicked.
    *   Full flow tested and working.
*   **Refined AI Feedback (Vibe Check):**
    *   Updated `getAIFeedback` in `aiService.ts` with a more structured prompt to guide the AI in providing feedback on vision refinement and learning suggestions, tailored to the user's vibe and the single matched dataset.
    *   Modified `vibeRoutes.ts` to limit search results to 1 and pass the matched dataset to `getAIFeedback`.
    *   (Frontend already displays this feedback, potentially with markdown rendering).

## Recent Changes
*   **Added "Awesome Public Datasets" Resource:** Updated `populateApiData.ts` script to include "Awesome Public Datasets (GitHub)". User ran the script successfully, and confirmed the new resource is discoverable in the VibeFlow UI. (2025-06-15)
*   **API Feature Verified via UI:** User confirmed "Suggested APIs" (including Google Maps API) are displayed correctly in the UI after successful backend redeployment and positive `curl` test. (2025-06-15)

## Next Steps
1.  **Commit Memory Bank Updates:**
    *   Commit the current updates to `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `techContext.md` to Git.
    *   Push changes to the remote repository.
2.  **Troubleshoot Frontend Login/Navigation Issue:**
    *   Investigate and fix the issue where the link from the sign-up page (`SignUpPage.tsx`) to the login page (`LoginPage.tsx`) was not working correctly. This was deferred during API testing.
3.  **Troubleshoot Mobile API Call Issue:**
    *   Investigate why API calls from mobile browsers might be failing, even if the backend is reachable directly from the mobile browser. Consider CORS, CSP, or specific mobile `fetch` behaviors.
4.  **Continue Curating API Resources:**
    *   Now that API search and display are functional, expand the `apis` collection in MongoDB with more diverse and relevant APIs.
    *   Run `populateApiData.ts` (or an enhanced version) to add new APIs and their embeddings.
5.  **Review and Refine Overall UX/UI:**
    *   Consider any minor UI tweaks for clarity or improved user flow based on current features, including the display of API results.
6.  **Consider AI Model Selection:**
    *   Revisit AI Model Selection (currently "Pending" for Gemini API key integration, though embedding and chat functionalities are working).

## Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **API Resource Discovery Feature:** Now fully functional end-to-end after successful backend redeployment and UI verification. Backend correctly returns `apiResults`, and frontend displays them.
*   **Frontend Configuration:** The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` runtime environment variable set on the frontend Cloud Run service is not sufficient. The variable needs to be available at *build time* for Vite to bake it into the static assets.
*   **Resolution Path:** Update the frontend's Cloud Build trigger with the correct `_VITE_API_BASE_URL` substitution variable and redeploy the frontend. (This is an ongoing consideration for frontend deployments).
*   **AI Feedback (Vibe Check):** Now provides more structured and focused feedback based on the user's vibe and the single top-matched dataset. (`@tailwindcss/typography` installed, and rendering verified by user).
*   **Backend Services (Initial & Vector Search):**
    *   Dataset vector search is implemented and working.
    *   API vector search is now implemented, deployed, and confirmed working.
*   **Frontend Connected to Backend:** `MainAppPage.tsx` calls the API.
*   **Frontend Connected to Backend:** `MainAppPage.tsx` calls the API.
*   **Backend Technology Stack:** Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript (Setup complete, initial services built).
*   **Real Authentication Implemented & Working:** Firebase/GCIP is the live authentication system.
*   **Initial Dataset Inserted & Embedded:** "Google Trends" dataset is in MongoDB with its `description_embedding` populated.
*   **Atlas Vector Search Index Created:** `vector_index_datasets_description` is active for the `datasets` collection.
*   **Core Product Direction: Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool** (Decision Made. Fully rolled out).
*   **Frontend Framework: React** (Decision Made and Implemented).
*   **Authentication Provider: Google Cloud Identity Platform** (Implementation complete and working).
*   **AI Model Selection:** Pending (e.g., Google Gemini - API key is in backend `.env` but integration not built).
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md`. The diagram in `systemPatterns.md` (which `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` now mirrors) is the current source of truth for system flow.
*   **Prioritization:** Commit current Memory Bank updates. Then, decide on next focus (more curation, API schema, or auth/backend).

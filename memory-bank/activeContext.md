# Active Context: VibeFlow

## Current Work Focus
*   **Backend Services & API Implementation (Initial):**
    *   `mongoService.ts`: Implemented MongoDB connection logic.
    *   `aiService.ts`: Implemented Gemini connection and `getTextEmbedding` function.
    *   `vibeRoutes.ts`: Created `/api/process-vibe` endpoint (with simulated DB search).
    *   `index.ts`: Integrated routes, error handling, and DB connection on startup.
*   **Frontend-Backend Connection:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx`: "Flow" button now calls `/api/process-vibe` and displays results/loading/errors.
*   **UI Branding Update:**
    *   Updated `index.html` favicon and title.
    *   Added `VibeFlow.png` logo to `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `MainAppPage.tsx`.
*   **Backend Project Setup (Node.js/Express with TypeScript):** Complete.
*   **Real Authentication Implementation (Firebase/GCIP):** Complete and working.
*   **Dataset Curation (MongoDB):** First dataset inserted.
*   **Strategic Shift & Documentation:** All Memory Bank documents are up-to-date.
*   **UI & Frontend Foundation Stable.**
*   **Version Control Up-to-Date (Locally):** All changes, including backend service/API implementation and vector search, are documented and will be committed shortly.
*   **Cloud Run Deployment Stable (Frontend).**
*   **Real Vector Search Implemented & Tested (Datasets):**
    *   Script created and run to populate `description_embedding` for the "Google Trends" dataset.
    *   Atlas Vector Search index `vector_index_datasets_description` created on `datasets.description_embedding`.
    *   `vibeRoutes.ts` updated to use real `$vectorSearch` aggregation.
    *   End-to-end flow tested successfully: vibe input -> embedding -> vector search -> results (including score and sample data snippet) displayed on frontend.
*   **Frontend Enhanced to Display Score and Sample Data:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to render the `score` and `sample_data_snippet` for matched datasets.
*   **Curated "App Ideas & Features" Dataset for Playground:**
    *   Defined and scripted the insertion of 3 sample "App Ideas & Features" documents into the `datasets` collection.
    *   Each new document includes a generated `description_embedding`.
    *   Confirmed these new app ideas are discoverable via vector search and display correctly on the frontend.
*   **Frontend: Added "Try in Playground" Button UI:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to display a "Try in Playground" button for datasets categorized as "Playground App Idea".
    *   Corrected `vibeRoutes.ts` to ensure the `category` field is projected to the frontend.
*   **Implemented Dataset Playground Functionality (End-to-End):**
    *   **AI Service:** `aiService.ts` updated with `generateSampleMongoQueries` function using the chat model.
    *   **Backend Routes:** Created `playgroundRoutes.ts` with endpoints for generating sample queries (`/generate-queries`) and executing them (`/execute-query`). Integrated into `index.ts`.
    *   **Frontend Logic:** `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to fetch sample queries when "Try in Playground" is clicked, display them as buttons, and then fetch and display results when a sample query button is clicked.
    *   Full flow tested and working.
*   **Refined AI Feedback (Vibe Check):**
    *   Updated `getAIFeedback` in `aiService.ts` with a more structured prompt to guide the AI in providing feedback on vision refinement and learning suggestions, tailored to the user's vibe and the single matched dataset.
    *   Modified `vibeRoutes.ts` to limit search results to 1 and pass the matched dataset to `getAIFeedback`.
    *   (Frontend already displays this feedback, potentially with markdown rendering).

## Recent Changes
*   **Improved AI Feedback (Vibe Check) Logic:**
    *   Modified `aiService.ts` to refine the prompt for `getAIFeedback`, aiming for more structured and targeted advice including "Refine Your Vision" and "Learn As You Go" points, contextualized by the single best-matched dataset.
    *   Updated `vibeRoutes.ts` to fetch only the top 1 dataset and pass its details to the feedback generation service.
*   **Implemented Full Dataset Playground Flow:**
    *   Enhanced `aiService.ts` to generate sample MongoDB queries via LLM.
    *   Added new backend routes (`playgroundRoutes.ts`) for query generation and execution.
    *   Updated `MainAppPage.tsx` to orchestrate the full playground interaction: fetching sample queries, allowing user selection, executing the chosen query, and displaying results.
*   **Added "Try in Playground" Button UI to Frontend:**
    *   Modified `MainAppPage.tsx` to conditionally render a "Try in Playground" button for specific datasets.
    *   Fixed a bug in `vibeRoutes.ts` to correctly project the `category` field.
*   **Added "App Ideas & Features" Sample Dataset:**
    *   Created `populateAppIdeasDataset.ts` script to define, generate embeddings for, and insert 3 sample "App Ideas & Features" documents into MongoDB.
    *   Successfully ran the script, making these new datasets available for vector search.
*   **Enhanced Frontend for Dataset Results:**
    *   Modified `MainAppPage.tsx` to display the vector search `score` and `sample_data_snippet` for each suggested dataset.
*   **Implemented Real Vector Search for Datasets:**
    *   Created `populateGoogleTrendsEmbedding.ts` script to generate and store embeddings in MongoDB.
    *   Successfully ran the script to populate the "Google Trends" dataset's `description_embedding`.
    *   Guided user to create the `vector_index_datasets_description` Atlas Vector Search index.
    *   Updated `vibeRoutes.ts` to replace simulated search with actual `$vectorSearch` aggregation.
    *   Tested and confirmed end-to-end vector search functionality.
*   **Implemented Initial Backend Logic:**
    *   Developed `mongoService.ts` for DB connection.
    *   Developed `aiService.ts` for Gemini embedding.
    *   Developed `vibeRoutes.ts` with `/api/process-vibe` endpoint (initially simulated, now real search).
    *   Updated `index.ts` to use routes and connect DB.
*   **Connected Frontend to Backend:** Updated `MainAppPage.tsx` to call the new API endpoint.

## Next Steps
1.  **Commit & Push All Recent Changes:** (Completed - No pending changes to commit as of 2025-06-14, working tree was clean).
2.  **Address `@tailwindcss/typography` Installation:** (Completed - Installed, configured, and markdown rendering verified by user on 2025-06-14).
3.  **Update `README.md`:** (Completed - Project description updated on 2025-06-14).
4.  **Continue Curating Other Resources (APIs, more Datasets):**
    *   Define schema for `apis` collection in MongoDB. (Completed 2025-06-14, documented in `systemPatterns.md`).
    *   Manually curate a small list (5-10) of common APIs (metadata, sample data snippets, vector embeddings).
        *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/populateApiData.ts` with 2 initial APIs (Google Maps JS, Public APIs GitHub).
        *   Added `populate:apis` script to `vibeflow-backend/package.json`.
        *   **Issue:** Script execution fails due to a persistent TypeScript error (TS2345) related to `api.description` type inference, despite explicit typing. User to investigate TS/ts-node environment or run with type error ignored.
    *   Generate and store embeddings for these APIs. (Blocked by script execution issue).
    *   Update/Create Atlas Vector Search indexes for APIs. (Blocked by script execution issue).
    *   Potentially add more diverse public datasets if desired.
5.  **Display Curated Learning Links (Static Initial Set - Frontend):**
    *   Add a section to the frontend to display a small, static set of general learning links (this is now distinct from the AI's learning *topic* suggestions). (Completed 2025-06-14 - Added section to `MainAppPage.tsx`).

## Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **AI Feedback (Vibe Check):** Now provides more structured and focused feedback based on the user's vibe and the single top-matched dataset. (`@tailwindcss/typography` installed, and rendering verified by user).
*   **Backend Services (Initial & Vector Search):** `mongoService`, `aiService` (embedding), and `/api/process-vibe` route (with real vector search for datasets) are implemented and working.
*   **Frontend Connected to Backend:** `MainAppPage.tsx` calls the API.
*   **Backend Technology Stack:** Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript (Setup complete, initial services built).
*   **Real Authentication Implemented & Working:** Firebase/GCIP is the live authentication system.
*   **Initial Dataset Inserted & Embedded:** "Google Trends" dataset is in MongoDB with its `description_embedding` populated.
*   **Atlas Vector Search Index Created:** `vector_index_datasets_description` is active for the `datasets` collection.
*   **Core Product Direction: Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool** (Decision Made. Fully rolled out).
*   **Frontend Framework: React** (Decision Made and Implemented).
*   **Authentication Provider: Google Cloud Identity Platform** (Implementation complete and working).
*   **AI Model Selection:** Pending (e.g., Google Gemini - API key is in backend `.env` but integration not built).
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md`. The diagram in `systemPatterns.md` (which `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` now mirrors) is the current source of truth for system flow.
*   **Prioritization:** Commit current Memory Bank updates. Then, decide on next focus (more curation, API schema, or auth/backend).

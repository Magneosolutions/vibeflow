# Active Context: VibeFlow

## Current Work Focus
*   **Strategic Shift to "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool":** VibeFlow's core concept has been redefined. The focus is now on assisting users in refining their ideas, discovering resources (datasets, APIs), and accessing curated learning materials, rather than full app generation.
*   **UI Update for `MainAppPage.tsx`:** Updated the main application page to reflect the new strategic direction with clear instructions and objectives for vibecoders.
*   **Memory Bank Overhaul (In Progress):** `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` have been updated to align with the new "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool" concept. `activeContext.md` (this file) and `progress.md` are currently being updated.
*   **UI Styling Complete & Stable:** Core UI components are styled, and the `Layout.tsx` styling issue is resolved.
*   **Frontend Foundation Stable:** Vite + React + TypeScript project (`vibeflow-frontend`) with routing and simulated auth is stable.
*   **Version Control Up-to-Date (Locally):** All changes, including strategic shifts and UI updates, are documented and will be committed shortly.
*   **Cloud Run Deployment Stable:** The frontend remains publicly accessible via Cloud Run.

## Recent Changes
*   **Updated Memory Bank (Strategic Shift):** Modified `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` to reflect the new product direction.
*   **Updated `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx`:** Added new introductory text explaining VibeFlow's role as an "Idea Co-Pilot" and its benefits for vibecoders.
*   **Strategic Redirection Brainstorming:** Shifted VibeFlow's focus to Option 3: "The Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool."
*   **Resolved UI Update for `Layout.tsx`:** New Tailwind styles and animations for `Layout.tsx` are correctly applying in Cloud Run.
*   **Committed and Pushed Previous Changes:** UI fixes and prior memory bank updates (before strategic shift) were pushed to GitHub.
*   **Successfully Deployed `vibeflow-frontend` to Cloud Run and Made Public:**
    *   Troubleshot Nginx exiting issue by enhancing `entrypoint.sh` with verbose logging and `nginx -t` config testing.
    *   Resolved "403 Forbidden" error by addressing IAM permissions.
    *   As administrator, overrode the "Domain Restricted Sharing" organization policy (`constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`) for the project by setting it to "Allow all".
    *   Successfully added `allUsers` with `Cloud Run Invoker` role to the `vibeflow` Cloud Run service.
    *   The application is now live and accessible.
*   Configured `vibeflow-frontend` for Cloud Run CI/CD (initial setup):
    *   Modified `nginx.conf` to use `${PORT}` and renamed to `nginx.conf.template`.
    *   Created `entrypoint.sh` to process `nginx.conf.template` and start Nginx.
    *   Updated `Dockerfile` to include `envsubst` (via `gettext`), copy new files, and use `entrypoint.sh`.
    *   Pushed these changes to the `Magneosolutions/vibeflow` GitHub repository.
*   Successfully pushed all project files to the new remote `https://github.com/Magneosolutions/vibeflow`, resolving unrelated histories.
*   Styled `Layout.tsx` with Tailwind CSS, including header, navigation, and footer.
*   Styled `MainAppPage.tsx` with Tailwind CSS, focusing on the main input area.
*   Confirmed current brand colors (`brand-primary`: Indigo, `brand-secondary`: Pink) in `tailwind.config.js` are acceptable.
*   Created `.gitignore` at the project root to exclude `Google/` and other specified files/folders.
    *   Initialized Git repository and pushed all project files (excluding ignored ones) to `git@github.com:mgesteban/vibeflow.git` (old remote).
*   Previously: Updated memory bank files (before strategic shift), created Vite project, configured Tailwind, implemented simulated auth, styled login/signup pages.

## Next Steps
1.  **Finalize Memory Bank Updates for Strategic Shift:**
    *   Update `activeContext.md` (this file - currently in progress).
    *   Update `progress.md` (next) to reflect the new strategic direction, UI changes to `MainAppPage.tsx`, and revised MVP tasks.
    *   Ensure `.clinerules` is consistent (Cloud Run patterns are okay, no new major patterns from this shift yet).
2.  **Commit & Push All Strategic Changes:** Commit all UI and memory bank updates (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx`) to GitHub.
3.  **Authentication Implementation (Real):**
    *   Proceed with planning and implementing actual authentication with Google Cloud Identity Platform.
4.  **Begin Phase 1 (MVP - Interactive Resource Discovery & Basic Feedback - Revised):**
    *   **Curate Initial Resources:**
        *   Manually curate a small list (20-30) of public datasets (metadata, sample data snippets) and store them in MongoDB Atlas with vector embeddings.
        *   Manually curate a small list (10-15) of common APIs (descriptions, use cases) and store them in MongoDB Atlas with vector embeddings.
    *   **Core "Vibe" Interaction (Backend):**
        *   Integrate AI (e.g., Gemini) for text analysis (key concept extraction, vector embedding generation).
    *   **Resource Matching & Display (Backend & Frontend):**
        *   Implement MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to match a vibe to datasets and APIs.
        *   Develop backend endpoints to serve these suggestions.
        *   Develop frontend components to display suggested datasets and APIs.
    *   **Basic AI "Vibe Check" (Backend & Frontend):**
        *   Implement a simple AI-driven feedback mechanism.
        *   Display this feedback on the frontend.
    *   **Curated Learning Links (Static Initial Set - Frontend):**
        *   Display a small, static set of general learning links.
    *   **Focus:** Make the "Vibe Input -> AI Analysis -> MongoDB Search -> Display Suggested Datasets/APIs + Basic AI Feedback" loop functional.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **Core Product Direction: Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool** (Decision Made. Implemented in `MainAppPage.tsx` intro text. Updates to `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md` are complete. `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` updates are in progress).
*   **Frontend Framework: React** (Decision Made and Implemented)
*   **Authentication Provider: Google Cloud Identity Platform** (Decision Made, next major implementation step after current Memory Bank updates and commit)
*   **Backend Framework Choice:** Decision pending (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI).
*   **AI Model Selection:** Decision pending (e.g., Google Gemini).
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md`. The diagram in `systemPatterns.md` (which `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` now mirrors) is the current source of truth for system flow.
*   **Prioritization:** Complete Memory Bank updates for strategic shift (including diagram rename), then commit. Then, real authentication implementation, followed by the revised Phase 1 MVP tasks.

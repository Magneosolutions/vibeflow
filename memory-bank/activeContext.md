# Active Context: VibeFlow

## Current Work Focus
*   **UI Styling & Refinement:** Applied Tailwind CSS to `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` to align with a reference design, focusing on a minimalistic aesthetic, larger form containers, and more rounded corners.
*   **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Switched from `create-react-app` to Vite for the `vibeflow-frontend` project.
    *   Installed `react-router-dom` for navigation.
    *   Set up basic project structure with `pages`, `components`, and `contexts` directories.
    *   Implemented a simulated authentication flow using React Context (`AuthContext.tsx`).
    *   Created placeholder components for `LoginPage`, `SignUpPage`, `MainAppPage`, and a `Layout` component.
    *   Configured Tailwind CSS for the project.

## Recent Changes
*   Updated `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `.clinerules`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md` to reflect UI/auth focus and technology choices (React, GCIP).
*   Created `vibeflow-frontend` project using Vite.
*   Installed and configured Tailwind CSS.
*   Implemented basic routing and simulated authentication.
*   Styled `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` with Tailwind CSS, increasing container size and corner rounding.

## Next Steps
1.  **Finalize Memory Bank Updates for UI/Auth:**
    *   Update `progress.md` (next step).
    *   `.clinerules` already updated with React & GCIP choices.
2.  **Continue UI Styling & Refinement:**
    *   Style the `Layout.tsx` component (header/navigation).
    *   Style the `MainAppPage.tsx`.
    *   Refine colors and any other specific Tailwind customizations in `tailwind.config.js` if needed.
3.  **Authentication Implementation (Real):**
    *   Begin planning and implementing actual authentication with Google Cloud Identity Platform, replacing the simulated flow.
    *   This involves backend setup (if any needed beyond GCIP) and frontend integration.
4.  **Begin Phase 1 (MVP) Core VibeFlow Functionality (after initial UI/auth shell is stable):**
    *   Detail the tasks for "Manually curate a small list (20-30) of high-quality public datasets and store them in MongoDB Atlas."
        *   Identify sources for public datasets (e.g., `awesome-public-datasets` on GitHub).
        *   Define the schema for storing dataset metadata in MongoDB.
        *   Plan the process for cleaning, categorizing, and generating vector embeddings for these datasets.
    *   Detail the tasks for "Build the core 'Vibe' input and use AI to generate vector embeddings."
        *   Design the frontend UI for the "Vibe" input.
        *   Select and plan integration with the AI model (e.g., Google Gemini) for text analysis and embedding generation.
    *   Detail the tasks for "Implement Vector Search to match a vibe to a dataset."
        *   Set up MongoDB Atlas with Vector Search capabilities.
        *   Develop backend logic to take the AI-generated embedding and query MongoDB.
    *   Detail the tasks for "Instead of generating code, just provide a link to a single, hard-coded boilerplate project on GitHub."
        *   Identify or create a suitable generic boilerplate project.
        *   Plan how to present this link to the user.
    *   Focus on the "MongoDB Search -> Suggested Dataset flow."

## Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **Frontend Framework: React** (Decision Made)
*   **Authentication Provider: Google Cloud Identity Platform** (Decision Made)
*   **Backend Framework Choice:** Decision pending (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI).
*   **AI Model Selection:** Decision pending (e.g., Google Gemini).
*   **`AudioFlowDiagram.md`:** Current version is sufficient.
*   **Prioritization within MVP:** Styling of remaining core UI elements (`Layout`, `MainAppPage`) and then moving to real authentication implementation are the next key steps before tackling the core VibeFlow dataset/AI features.

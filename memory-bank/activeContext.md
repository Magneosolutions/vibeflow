# Active Context: VibeFlow Memory Bank Initialization

## 1. Current Work Focus
The primary focus is the **initialization and population of the VibeFlow Memory Bank**. This involves creating or updating all core memory bank documents to establish a comprehensive and accurate baseline for the project.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
*   **`projectbrief.md` Updated (Timestamp: 2025-06-17 ~09:05 AM PST):**
    *   Populated with the project's mission, vision, core objectives, target audience ("vibecoders"), key features, success criteria, scope (MVP), and core principles. This serves as the foundational document.
*   **`productContext.md` Updated (Timestamp: 2025-06-17 ~09:05 AM PST):**
    *   Reviewed and refined to align with `projectbrief.md`.
    *   Emphasized the "vibecoder" persona and clarified the problems VibeFlow solves and its core user value.
*   **Decision:** Proceed with populating the remaining core memory bank files systematically.

## 3. Next Steps
1.  **Update `systemPatterns.md`:** Document the high-level system architecture, data flow, key technology choices, and design patterns. Incorporate or reference `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`.
2.  **Update `techContext.md`:** Detail the technology stack, development environment, build/deploy processes, and technical constraints.
3.  **Update `progress.md`:** Outline completed features (currently focused on memory bank setup), work in progress, backlog, and known issues.
4.  **Create and Populate `memory-bank/.clinerules`:** Establish the initial project intelligence file with guidelines, preferences, and learned patterns.
5.  **Review `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Ensure it's accurate and integrate its insights into `systemPatterns.md`.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **Information Source:** For `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md`, I will need to infer some information based on the file structure provided in `environment_details` (e.g., presence of `vibeflow-backend` and `vibeflow-frontend`, Dockerfiles, `package.json` files indicating Node.js/React, TypeScript usage). I will make reasonable assumptions and document them.
*   **Level of Detail:** For this initial population, the goal is to provide a solid foundation. Details can be expanded iteratively as the project progresses.
*   **`.clinerules` Content:** Initial rules will focus on maintaining the memory bank itself and any immediately obvious project conventions.
*   **Priority:** Ensure all core memory bank files are created and have foundational content before concluding the "initiate memory bank" task.
*   **New Task (User Feedback):** Create a new dataset and script (`populateOutdoorSportsApps.ts`) for outdoor/sports app ideas. (Timestamp: 2025-06-17 ~09:24 AM PST)
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/populateOutdoorSportsApps.ts`.
    *   Resolved a TypeScript error in the new script.
*   **Update Vibe Processing (User Feedback):** Modified `vibeflow-backend/src/routes/vibeRoutes.ts` to return 4 dataset suggestions instead of 5. (Timestamp: 2025-06-17 ~09:34 AM PST)
*   **Create AI Dataset Generator Script (User Request):** (Timestamp: 2025-06-17 ~09:46 AM PST)
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/aiDatasetGenerator.ts` with AI-powered content generation logic.
    *   Added `populate-dataset:ai-generated` script to `vibeflow-backend/package.json`.
*   **Fix Frontend Dataset Display (User Feedback):** (Timestamp: 2025-06-17 ~10:12 AM PST)
    *   Reverted `ApiResult` interface in `MainAppPage.tsx` to use `searchResults` key to match the current `vibeRoutes.ts`.
    *   Reverted `SearchResultItem` interface in `MainAppPage.tsx` to use `snake_case` for properties (e.g., `source_url`, `sample_data_snippet`) and added other projected fields to match `vibeRoutes.ts`.
    *   Updated JSX in `MainAppPage.tsx` to use `apiResults.searchResults` and `snake_case` properties.
    *   This aligns the frontend with the backend which now returns 3 results under `searchResults`.
*   **Create Entertainment App Check Script (User Request):** (Timestamp: 2025-06-17 ~11:51 AM PST)
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/checkEntertainmentApps.ts` to query entertainment/music app ideas.
    *   Added `check:entertainment-apps` script to `vibeflow-backend/package.json`.
*   **Create Food & Cooking App Dataset Script (User Request):** (Timestamp: 2025-06-17 ~11:57 AM PST)
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/addCookingFoodApps.ts` with a curated list of food/cooking app ideas.
    *   Resolved a TypeScript error in the new script.
    *   Added `populate-dataset:food-cooking` script to `vibeflow-backend/package.json`.
*   **Create Music & Entertainment App Dataset Script (User Request):** (Timestamp: 2025-06-17 ~12:17 PM PST)
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/addMusicEntertainmentApps.ts` with a curated list of music/entertainment app ideas.
    *   Resolved a TypeScript error in the new script.
    *   Added `populate-dataset:music-entertainment` script to `vibeflow-backend/package.json`.

# Active Context: VibeFlow

## Current Work Focus
*   **Dataset Curation (MongoDB):** Successfully defined schema and inserted the first dataset ("Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)") into `vibeflow_db.datasets` collection via VS Code playground.
*   **Strategic Shift to "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool":** VibeFlow's core concept has been redefined.
*   **UI Update for `MainAppPage.tsx`:** Updated to reflect the new strategic direction.
*   **Memory Bank Overhaul (Complete):** All core documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md` (this file), `progress.md`) and `.clinerules` are now updated to reflect the strategic shift, UI changes, diagram rename, and initial dataset curation.
*   **UI Styling Complete & Stable:** Core UI components are styled.
*   **Frontend Foundation Stable:** Vite + React + TypeScript project (`vibeflow-frontend`) with routing and simulated auth is stable.
*   **Version Control Up-to-Date (Locally):** All changes, including dataset curation and memory bank updates, are documented and will be committed shortly.
*   **Cloud Run Deployment Stable:** The frontend remains publicly accessible via Cloud Run.

## Recent Changes
*   **Initial Dataset Curation:**
    *   Defined schema for `datasets` collection in MongoDB.
    *   Guided user to insert the "Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)" dataset document into `vibeflow_db.datasets` via VS Code playground. Confirmed successful insertion.
*   **Memory Bank Updates (Strategic Shift & Diagram Rename):**
    *   Updated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `.clinerules` to reflect the new product direction and the renaming of `AudioFlowDiagram.md` to `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`.
    *   Created `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` and deleted the old diagram file.
*   **Updated `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx`:** Added new introductory text explaining VibeFlow's role as an "Idea Co-Pilot".
*   **Navigation Fixes:** Ensured `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` correctly navigate to the main app after successful authentication.
*   **Strategic Redirection Brainstorming:** Shifted VibeFlow's focus to Option 3: "The Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool."
*   **Resolved UI Update for `Layout.tsx`:** New Tailwind styles and animations for `Layout.tsx` are correctly applying in Cloud Run.
*   **Committed and Pushed Previous Changes:** UI fixes, strategic shift memory bank updates, and prior changes were pushed to GitHub.
*   **Successfully Deployed `vibeflow-frontend` to Cloud Run and Made Public.**
*   **Configured `vibeflow-frontend` for Cloud Run CI/CD (initial setup).**

## Next Steps
1.  **Commit & Push All Recent Changes:** Commit all memory bank updates (reflecting dataset curation) to GitHub.
2.  **Decide Next Focus:**
    *   Continue curating datasets.
    *   Define schema for an `apis` collection.
    *   Discuss other VibeFlow development tasks (e.g., real authentication, backend planning).
3.  **If Continuing Curation/Schema Definition:**
    *   Proceed with selected task (e.g., define API schema or pick next dataset).
4.  **If Switching to Authentication/Backend:**
    *   Begin planning for real authentication with Google Cloud Identity Platform or backend API structure. This aligns with the next major step outlined in `progress.md`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **Initial Dataset Inserted:** The first dataset ("Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)") is now in the `vibeflow_db.datasets` collection.
*   **Core Product Direction: Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool** (Decision Made. Fully rolled out across all Memory Bank documents and relevant UI).
*   **Frontend Framework: React** (Decision Made and Implemented).
*   **Authentication Provider: Google Cloud Identity Platform** (Decision Made, next major implementation step after current Memory Bank updates and commit).
*   **Backend Framework Choice:** Decision pending (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI).
*   **AI Model Selection:** Decision pending (e.g., Google Gemini).
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md`. The diagram in `systemPatterns.md` (which `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` now mirrors) is the current source of truth for system flow.
*   **Prioritization:** Commit current Memory Bank updates. Then, decide on next focus (more curation, API schema, or auth/backend).

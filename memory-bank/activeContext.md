# Active Context: VibeFlow

## Current Work Focus
*   **UI Styling Complete:** Core UI components (`LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, `Layout.tsx`, `MainAppPage.tsx`) have been styled using Tailwind CSS. Brand colors in `tailwind.config.js` confirmed.
*   **Frontend Foundation:** Vite + React + TypeScript project (`vibeflow-frontend`) is set up with basic routing, simulated authentication (`AuthContext.tsx`), and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Version Control:** Initial project files pushed to GitHub, ignoring the `Google/` directory. The remote was updated to `https://github.com/Magneosolutions/vibeflow`.
*   **Cloud Run CI/CD Configuration & Troubleshooting:** Configured `vibeflow-frontend` Dockerfile, Nginx, and an entrypoint script for CI/CD to Cloud Run. Successfully troubleshot deployment issues related to Nginx startup and public access permissions. The frontend is now publicly accessible via Cloud Run.

## Recent Changes
*   **Successfully Deployed `vibeflow-frontend` to Cloud Run and Made Public:**
    *   Troubleshot Nginx exiting issue by enhancing `entrypoint.sh` with verbose logging and `nginx -t` config testing.
    *   Resolved "403 Forbidden" error by addressing IAM permissions.
    *   As administrator, overrode the "Domain Restricted Sharing" organization policy (`constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`) for the project by setting it to "Allow all".
    *   Successfully added `allUsers` with `Cloud Run Invoker` role to the `vibeflow` Cloud Run service.
    *   The application is now live and accessible.
*   Configured `vibeflow-frontend` for Cloud Run CI/CD (initial setup):
    *   Modified `nginx.conf` to use `${PORT}` and renamed to `nginx.conf.template`.
    *   Created `entrypoint.sh` to process `nginx.conf.template` and start Nginx.
    *   Updated `Dockerfile` to include `envsubst` (via `gettext`), copy new files, and use `entrypoint.sh`.
    *   Pushed these changes to the `Magneosolutions/vibeflow` GitHub repository.
*   Successfully pushed all project files to the new remote `https://github.com/Magneosolutions/vibeflow`, resolving unrelated histories.
*   Styled `Layout.tsx` with Tailwind CSS, including header, navigation, and footer.
*   Styled `MainAppPage.tsx` with Tailwind CSS, focusing on the main input area.
*   Confirmed current brand colors (`brand-primary`: Indigo, `brand-secondary`: Pink) in `tailwind.config.js` are acceptable.
*   Created `.gitignore` at the project root to exclude `Google/` and other specified files/folders.
*   Initialized Git repository and pushed all project files (excluding ignored ones) to `git@github.com:mgesteban/vibeflow.git` (old remote).
*   Previously: Updated memory bank files, created Vite project, configured Tailwind, implemented simulated auth, styled login/signup pages.

## Next Steps
1.  **Finalize Memory Bank Updates:**
    *   Update `progress.md` to reflect completion of UI styling, Cloud Run CI/CD setup, and set next steps.
    *   `.clinerules` already reflects React & GCIP choices. Consider adding notes about Cloud Run Docker/Nginx patterns.
2.  **Authentication Implementation (Real):**
    *   Begin planning and implementing actual authentication with Google Cloud Identity Platform, replacing the simulated flow.
    *   This involves frontend integration with GCIP SDK and potentially backend adjustments if required by GCIP.
3.  **Begin Phase 1 (MVP) Core VibeFlow Functionality (after real authentication is stable):**
    *   Detail the tasks for "Manually curate a small list (20-30) of high-quality public datasets and store them in MongoDB Atlas."
        *   Identify sources for public datasets (e.g., `awesome-public-datasets` on GitHub).
        *   Define the schema for storing dataset metadata in MongoDB.
        *   Plan the process for cleaning, categorizing, and generating vector embeddings for these datasets.
    *   Detail the tasks for "Build the core 'Vibe' input and use AI to generate vector embeddings."
        *   Design the frontend UI for the "Vibe" input.
        *   Select and plan integration with the AI model (e.g., Google Gemini) for text analysis and embedding generation.
    *   Detail the tasks for "Implement Vector Search to match a vibe to a dataset."
        *   Set up MongoDB Atlas with Vector Search capabilities.
        *   Develop backend logic to take the AI-generated embedding and query MongoDB.
    *   Detail the tasks for "Instead of generating code, just provide a link to a single, hard-coded boilerplate project on GitHub."
        *   Identify or create a suitable generic boilerplate project.
        *   Plan how to present this link to the user.
    *   Focus on the "MongoDB Search -> Suggested Dataset flow."

## Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **Frontend Framework: React** (Decision Made and Implemented)
*   **Authentication Provider: Google Cloud Identity Platform** (Decision Made, next major implementation step)
*   **Backend Framework Choice:** Decision pending (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI).
*   **AI Model Selection:** Decision pending (e.g., Google Gemini).
*   **`AudioFlowDiagram.md`:** Current version is sufficient.
*   **Prioritization:** Real authentication implementation is the next key step before tackling the core VibeFlow dataset/AI features from Phase 1 MVP.

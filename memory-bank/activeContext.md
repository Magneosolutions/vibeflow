# Active Context: VibeFlow

## Current Work Focus
*   **Real Authentication Implementation (Firebase/GCIP):**
    *   Firebase SDK installed and `firebaseConfig.ts` created with project credentials.
    *   `AuthContext.tsx` rewritten to use Firebase for all auth operations (signup, login, logout, session management via `onAuthStateChanged`).
    *   `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `App.tsx` updated to integrate with the new Firebase-backed `AuthContext`, including error handling and loading states.
    *   Simulated authentication has been replaced with real authentication.
*   **Dataset Curation (MongoDB):** First dataset ("Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)") successfully inserted.
*   **Strategic Shift & Documentation:** Core concept ("Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool") and all Memory Bank documents are up-to-date.
*   **UI & Frontend Foundation Stable.**
*   **Version Control Up-to-Date (Locally):** All changes, including Firebase auth integration, are documented and will be committed shortly.
*   **Cloud Run Deployment Stable.**

## Recent Changes
*   **Integrated Firebase Authentication:**
    *   Installed Firebase SDK.
    *   Created `firebaseConfig.ts` with project credentials.
    *   Rewrote `AuthContext.tsx` to use Firebase.
    *   Updated `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `App.tsx` for Firebase integration.
*   **Initial Dataset Curation:**
    *   Defined schema for `datasets` collection in MongoDB.
    *   Guided user to insert the "Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)" dataset document into `vibeflow_db.datasets` via VS Code playground. Confirmed successful insertion.
*   **Memory Bank Updates (Strategic Shift & Diagram Rename):**
    *   Updated all core memory bank files and `.clinerules` for strategic shift and diagram rename.
*   **Updated `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx`:** Added new introductory text.
*   **Navigation Fixes:** Ensured `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` correctly navigate after auth.
*   **Strategic Redirection Brainstorming:** Shifted VibeFlow's focus.
*   **Resolved UI Update for `Layout.tsx`:** New Tailwind styles and animations for `Layout.tsx` are correctly applying in Cloud Run.
*   **Committed and Pushed Previous Changes:** UI fixes, strategic shift memory bank updates, and prior changes were pushed to GitHub.
*   **Successfully Deployed `vibeflow-frontend` to Cloud Run and Made Public.**
*   **Configured `vibeflow-frontend` for Cloud Run CI/CD (initial setup).**

## Next Steps
1.  **Commit & Push All Recent Changes:** Commit Firebase authentication integration and associated memory bank updates to GitHub.
2.  **Thoroughly Test Real Authentication:** Verify sign-up, sign-in with new and existing users, sign-out, error handling (wrong password, email exists, etc.), and session persistence across page reloads.
3.  **Decide Next Focus (Post-Auth Testing):**
    *   Continue curating datasets (target: 1 more for POC, then more later).
    *   Define schema for an `apis` collection.
    *   Begin backend development for "Vibe" interaction (AI analysis, MongoDB search).
    *   Begin frontend development for displaying search results and AI feedback.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
*   **Real Authentication Implemented:** Firebase/GCIP is now the live authentication system.
*   **Initial Dataset Inserted:** One dataset is in MongoDB.
*   **Core Product Direction: Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool** (Decision Made. Fully rolled out).
*   **Frontend Framework: React** (Decision Made and Implemented).
*   **Authentication Provider: Google Cloud Identity Platform** (Implementation complete, pending testing).
*   **Backend Framework Choice:** Decision pending (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI).
*   **AI Model Selection:** Decision pending (e.g., Google Gemini).
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md`. The diagram in `systemPatterns.md` (which `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` now mirrors) is the current source of truth for system flow.
*   **Prioritization:** Commit current Memory Bank updates. Then, decide on next focus (more curation, API schema, or auth/backend).

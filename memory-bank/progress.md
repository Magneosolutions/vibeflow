# Progress: VibeFlow

## Current Status: Strategic Shift to "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool" - Memory Bank Updated, UI Text Updated. Ready for Real Authentication.

### What Works (Implemented & Documented)
*   **Strategic Product Direction Defined:** VibeFlow is now an "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool." Core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, this file) reflect this new direction.
*   **UI Updated for New Direction:** `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx` updated with introductory text explaining the new focus.
*   **Frontend Project Setup (Vite + React + TypeScript):** `vibeflow-frontend` directory created and configured.
*   **Basic Routing:** Implemented using `react-router-dom` for `/login`, `/signup`, and `/` (main app).
*   **Real Authentication with Firebase (Google Cloud Identity Platform):**
    *   Firebase SDK installed and configured in `firebaseConfig.ts`.
    *   `AuthContext.tsx` rewritten to use Firebase for sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and session management (`onAuthStateChanged`).
    *   `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` updated for Firebase integration, including improved error handling and navigation.
    *   `App.tsx` updated to handle Firebase auth loading state.
    *   Simulated authentication flow has been replaced.
*   **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Installed and configured.
*   **Comprehensive UI Styling:**
    *   Styled `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` with Tailwind CSS (larger forms, rounded corners).
    *   Styled `Layout.tsx` (header, navigation, footer).
    *   Styled `MainAppPage.tsx` (main input area).
    *   Brand colors (`brand-primary`: Indigo, `brand-secondary`: Pink) confirmed in `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   `.gitignore` created at project root to exclude `Google/` and other specified items.
    *   Project initialized as a Git repository.
    *   All project files successfully pushed to the new remote `https://github.com/Magneosolutions/vibeflow` (resolved unrelated histories).
*   **Cloud Run CI/CD Configuration & Deployment (`vibeflow-frontend`):**
    *   Dockerfile updated to use an entrypoint script and install `envsubst`.
    *   Nginx configuration (`nginx.conf.template`) modified to use `${PORT}`.
    *   `entrypoint.sh` created to substitute `$PORT`, test Nginx config, and start Nginx.
    *   Successfully troubleshot initial Nginx exit issue by enhancing `entrypoint.sh` logging.
    *   Successfully resolved "403 Forbidden" access issue by:
        *   As administrator, overriding the "Domain Restricted Sharing" organization policy for the project to "Allow all".
        *   Granting `Cloud Run Invoker` role to `allUsers` for the `vibeflow` service.
    *   The `vibeflow-frontend` application is now live and publicly accessible via Cloud Run.
    *   All related changes pushed to GitHub.
*   **UI Update for `Layout.tsx` (Resolved):**
    *   New vibrant design for `Layout.tsx` and animation definitions in `tailwind.config.js` were implemented and pushed.
    *   TypeScript errors related to `<style jsx>` were resolved by moving animations to Tailwind config and reinstalling dependencies.
    *   Cloud Build and Cloud Run deployments were successful.
    *   **Resolution:** The new Tailwind CSS styles and animations for `Layout.tsx` are now correctly applying in the deployed Cloud Run environment.
*   **Memory Bank Overhaul for Strategic Shift:** All core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) and `.clinerules` are now updated to reflect the new product direction, UI changes, and revised MVP.
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md` and updated to match the diagram in `systemPatterns.md`. This is the current source of truth for system flow.
*   **Initial Dataset Curation (MongoDB):**
    *   Defined schema for `datasets` collection.
    *   Successfully curated and inserted the first dataset ("Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)") into the `vibeflow_db.datasets` collection in MongoDB via VS Code playground.
*   **Navigation Fixes:** Ensured `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` correctly navigate to the main app after successful authentication.
*   **Backend Project Setup (Node.js/Express with TypeScript):**
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend` directory.
    *   Initialized `npm` and installed core dependencies (Express, MongoDB driver, Gemini SDK, dotenv, cors) and dev dependencies (TypeScript, ts-node, nodemon, types).
    *   Configured `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Established basic project structure (`src` with `index.ts`, `routes`, `services`, `config` subdirectories).
    *   Created `.gitignore` and a template `.env` file (populated by user).
    *   Implemented a basic Express server in `src/index.ts`.
    *   Added `build`, `start`, `dev` scripts to `package.json`.

### What's Left to Build (Phase 1 - MVP - Revised for Interactive Refinement & Learning)
*   **Thoroughly Test Real Authentication:** Ensure sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, error handling, and session persistence work as expected. (User confirmed auth works).
*   **Backend Development (Core VibeFlow Logic):**
    *   Implement MongoDB connection in `mongoService.ts`.
    *   Implement AI interaction (embedding, insights) in `aiService.ts`.
    *   Develop `/api/process-vibe` endpoint in `vibeRoutes.ts` to orchestrate AI and MongoDB services.
    *   Connect frontend "Flow" button to this backend endpoint.
*   **Continue Curating Initial Resources (MongoDB Atlas):**
    *   Manually curate remaining public datasets (target: 19-29 more, or as decided for POC).
    *   Define schema for `apis` collection.
    *   Manually curate 10-15 common APIs (metadata, sample data snippets, vector embeddings).
*   **Core "Vibe" Interaction (Backend):**
    *   Integrate AI (e.g., Gemini) for text analysis (key concept extraction, vector embedding generation).
*   **Resource Matching & Display (Backend & Frontend):**
    *   Implement MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to match a vibe to datasets and APIs.
    *   Develop backend endpoints to serve these suggestions.
    *   Develop frontend components to display suggested datasets and APIs.
*   **Basic AI "Vibe Check" (Backend & Frontend):**
    *   Implement a simple AI-driven feedback mechanism (e.g., on scope, common considerations).
    *   Display this feedback on the frontend.
*   **Curated Learning Links (Static Initial Set - Frontend):**
    *   Display a small, static set of general learning links relevant to app development.
*   **Focus:** Make the "Vibe Input -> AI Analysis -> MongoDB Search -> Display Suggested Datasets/APIs + Basic AI Feedback" loop functional.

### Known Issues & Blockers
*   **Backend Tech Stack Decision:** Resolved (Node.js/Express with TypeScript).
*   **AI Model Selection & Access:** Pending (e.g., Google Gemini - API key is in `.env` but integration not built).
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` Naming:** Resolved.

### Overall Project Health
*   **Green:** Real authentication with Firebase/GCIP is integrated and reported working. Backend project structure for Node.js/Express is established. Strategic direction is clear and documented. UI reflects new direction. Frontend foundation and Cloud Run deployment are stable. Memory Bank is updated. Next steps involve building out backend logic for core VibeFlow features.

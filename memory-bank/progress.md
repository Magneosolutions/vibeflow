# Progress: VibeFlow

## Current Status: Strategic Shift to "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool" - Memory Bank Updated, UI Text Updated. Ready for Real Authentication.

### What Works (Implemented & Documented)
*   **Strategic Product Direction Defined:** VibeFlow is now an "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool." Core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, this file) reflect this new direction.
*   **UI Updated for New Direction:** `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx` updated with introductory text explaining the new focus.
*   **Frontend Project Setup (Vite + React + TypeScript):** `vibeflow-frontend` directory created and configured.
*   **Basic Routing:** Implemented using `react-router-dom` for `/login`, `/signup`, and `/` (main app).
*   **Simulated Authentication Flow:**
    *   `AuthContext.tsx` created to manage simulated auth state.
    *   `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `Layout.tsx` use this context.
    *   Demo credentials (`demo@example.com` / `password123`) allow "login/signup".
    *   Protected route for the main application page.
*   **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Installed and configured.
*   **Comprehensive UI Styling:**
    *   Styled `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` with Tailwind CSS (larger forms, rounded corners).
    *   Styled `Layout.tsx` (header, navigation, footer).
    *   Styled `MainAppPage.tsx` (main input area).
    *   Brand colors (`brand-primary`: Indigo, `brand-secondary`: Pink) confirmed in `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   `.gitignore` created at project root to exclude `Google/` and other specified items.
    *   Project initialized as a Git repository.
    *   All project files successfully pushed to the new remote `https://github.com/Magneosolutions/vibeflow` (resolved unrelated histories).
*   **Cloud Run CI/CD Configuration & Deployment (`vibeflow-frontend`):**
    *   Dockerfile updated to use an entrypoint script and install `envsubst`.
    *   Nginx configuration (`nginx.conf.template`) modified to use `${PORT}`.
    *   `entrypoint.sh` created to substitute `$PORT`, test Nginx config, and start Nginx.
    *   Successfully troubleshot initial Nginx exit issue by enhancing `entrypoint.sh` logging.
    *   Successfully resolved "403 Forbidden" access issue by:
        *   As administrator, overriding the "Domain Restricted Sharing" organization policy for the project to "Allow all".
        *   Granting `Cloud Run Invoker` role to `allUsers` for the `vibeflow` service.
    *   The `vibeflow-frontend` application is now live and publicly accessible via Cloud Run.
    *   All related changes pushed to GitHub.
*   **UI Update for `Layout.tsx` (Resolved):**
    *   New vibrant design for `Layout.tsx` and animation definitions in `tailwind.config.js` were implemented and pushed.
    *   TypeScript errors related to `<style jsx>` were resolved by moving animations to Tailwind config and reinstalling dependencies.
    *   Cloud Build and Cloud Run deployments were successful.
    *   **Resolution:** The new Tailwind CSS styles and animations for `Layout.tsx` are now correctly applying in the deployed Cloud Run environment.
*   **Memory Bank Overhaul for Strategic Shift:** All core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) and `.clinerules` are now updated to reflect the new product direction, UI changes, and revised MVP.
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md` and updated to match the diagram in `systemPatterns.md`. This is the current source of truth for system flow.

### What's Left to Build (Phase 1 - MVP - Revised for Interactive Refinement & Learning)
*   **Real Authentication Implementation:** Integrate Google Cloud Identity Platform, replacing the simulated flow.
*   **Curate Initial Resources (MongoDB Atlas):**
    *   Manually curate 20-30 public datasets (metadata, sample data snippets, vector embeddings).
    *   Manually curate 10-15 common APIs (descriptions, use cases, vector embeddings).
*   **Core "Vibe" Interaction (Backend):**
    *   Integrate AI (e.g., Gemini) for text analysis (key concept extraction, vector embedding generation).
*   **Resource Matching & Display (Backend & Frontend):**
    *   Implement MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to match a vibe to datasets and APIs.
    *   Develop backend endpoints to serve these suggestions.
    *   Develop frontend components to display suggested datasets and APIs.
*   **Basic AI "Vibe Check" (Backend & Frontend):**
    *   Implement a simple AI-driven feedback mechanism (e.g., on scope, common considerations).
    *   Display this feedback on the frontend.
*   **Curated Learning Links (Static Initial Set - Frontend):**
    *   Display a small, static set of general learning links relevant to app development.
*   **Focus:** Make the "Vibe Input -> AI Analysis -> MongoDB Search -> Display Suggested Datasets/APIs + Basic AI Feedback" loop functional.

### Known Issues & Blockers
*   **Backend Tech Stack Decision:** Pending (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI).
*   **AI Model Selection & Access:** Pending (e.g., Google Gemini).
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` Naming:** Resolved.

### Overall Project Health
*   **Green:** Strategic direction clarified and documented. UI updated to reflect new direction. Frontend foundation and Cloud Run deployment are stable. Memory Bank is fully updated with the strategic shift. Next major step is real authentication, followed by the revised Phase 1 MVP.

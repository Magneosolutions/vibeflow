# Progress: VibeFlow

## 1. Completed Features & Milestones
*   **Memory Bank Initialization (In Progress, Nearing Completion):**
    *   `projectbrief.md`: Created and populated with foundational project details.
    *   `productContext.md`: Reviewed, updated, and aligned with project brief.
    *   `activeContext.md`: Created and populated, outlining current memory bank initialization tasks.
    *   `systemPatterns.md`: Created and populated with inferred architecture, component breakdown, and data flow based on `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` and project structure.
    *   `techContext.md`: Created and populated with inferred technology stack, tools, and platforms.
    *   `SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`: Reviewed.
*   **Initial Project Scaffolding (Evident from file structure):**
    *   Separate `vibeflow-frontend` and `vibeflow-backend` directories.
    *   Basic Docker setup for both frontend and backend.
    *   TypeScript configuration for both projects.
    *   Frontend structure with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS.
    *   Backend structure (likely Node.js/Express).
    *   Firebase integration started (`firebaseConfig.ts`).
    *   Initial data population/embedding scripts created in `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/` (e.g., `populateAppIdeasDataset.ts`, `populateGoogleTrendsEmbedding.ts`).
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/populateOutdoorSportsApps.ts` to add a specialized dataset for outdoor/sports app ideas.
    *   Modified `vibeflow-backend/src/routes/vibeRoutes.ts` to return 4 dataset suggestions instead of 5.
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/aiDatasetGenerator.ts` for AI-powered generation of diverse app ideas.
    *   Added `populate-dataset:ai-generated` script to `vibeflow-backend/package.json`.
*   **Frontend Display Fix (Alignment with `vibeRoutes.ts` v. user edit):**
    *   Aligned `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx` with the current `vibeRoutes.ts` structure:
        *   Dataset suggestions are now expected under the `searchResults` key.
        *   Properties within dataset items are expected in `snake_case`.
        *   The frontend will now display up to 3 dataset suggestions as per `vibeRoutes.ts`.
*   **Entertainment App Check Script:**
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/checkEntertainmentApps.ts` for querying entertainment/music app ideas.
    *   Added `check:entertainment-apps` script to `vibeflow-backend/package.json`.
*   **Food & Cooking App Dataset Script:**
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/addCookingFoodApps.ts` with a curated list of food/cooking app ideas.
    *   Added `populate-dataset:food-cooking` script to `vibeflow-backend/package.json`.
*   **Music & Entertainment App Dataset Script:**
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/addMusicEntertainmentApps.ts` with a curated list of music/entertainment app ideas.
    *   Added `populate-dataset:music-entertainment` script to `vibeflow-backend/package.json`.
*   **Added Selfcare & Mental Health Domain to AI Dataset Generator:** (Timestamp: 2025-06-22 ~11:10 AM PST)
    *   Added a new category to the `APP_CATEGORIES` array in `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/aiDatasetGenerator.ts` with the domain "Selfcare & Mental Health" and relevant themes.
*   **Renamed AI Dataset Generator Script:** (Timestamp: 2025-06-22 ~11:32 AM PST)
    *   Renamed `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/aiDatasetGenerator.ts` to `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/selfcareapp.ts`.
    *   Updated the script in `package.json` to reflect this change.
*   **Ensured 3 Dataset Suggestions are Returned:** (Timestamp: 2025-06-22 ~11:59 AM PST)
    *   Updated the `$limit` in the `vibeRoutes.ts` file to 3 in both the enhanced embedding search and the description embedding search.

## 2. Currently In Development
*   **Memory Bank Initialization (Finalizing):**
    *   Populating this `progress.md` file.
    *   Creating and populating `memory-bank/.clinerules`.
*   **Core Application Logic (Assumed based on project goals, but not yet explicitly detailed):**
    *   User input handling for "vibes."
    *   Backend API endpoints for vibe analysis and resource discovery.
    *   Integration with AI model(s).
    *   Integration with MongoDB for resource querying.
    *   Frontend components for displaying vibes, suggestions, and feedback.

## 3. Backlog / Planned Features (Derived from `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`)
*   **MVP Features (Core Loop):**
    *   Functional vibe input mechanism on the frontend.
    *   Backend endpoint to receive and process vibes.
    *   AI-driven analysis of vibes (NLP, embedding, basic feedback).
    *   AI-driven resource suggestions (datasets, APIs, learning links) from MongoDB.
    *   Display of AI feedback and resource suggestions on the frontend.
    *   Iterative refinement loop (user modifies vibe, gets updated suggestions/feedback).
*   **Authentication & Personalization (Post-MVP or parallel if simple):**
    *   User signup and login using Firebase Authentication.
    *   Secure API endpoints.
    *   (Future) Saving user vibes and history.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Polished and intuitive user interface.
    *   Clear presentation of complex information.
    *   Responsive design.
*   **Expanded Resource Catalog:**
    *   Ongoing curation and addition of datasets, APIs, and learning materials to MongoDB.
*   **Advanced AI Features (Future):**
    *   More sophisticated "Vibe Check" (e.g., identifying potential contradictions, suggesting alternative approaches).
    *   Deeper learning pathway generation.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Unit tests for critical components (frontend and backend).
    *   Integration tests for API endpoints and core flows.
    *   End-to-end tests for user scenarios.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Automated build, test, and deployment to Google Cloud Run.

## 4. Known Issues & Technical Debt
*   **Placeholder Content:** Some memory bank files initially had placeholder content (now being addressed).
*   **Inferred Information:** Much of `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` is based on inference from file structure and naming conventions. This needs validation as development progresses (e.g., by inspecting `package.json` files for exact libraries).
*   **Missing Details:** Specifics of AI model choice, detailed database schemas, and precise API contracts are not yet documented.
*   **No User-Facing Functionality Yet:** The application is in the foundational setup phase.
*   **Testing Framework:** Not yet defined or implemented.
*   **Error Handling & Logging:** Needs to be systematically implemented across frontend and backend.
*   **Script Execution:**
    *   Added npm script for `populateOutdoorSportsApps.ts`.
    *   Added npm script for `aiDatasetGenerator.ts`.
    *   Added npm script for `checkEntertainmentApps.ts`.
    *   Added npm script for `addCookingFoodApps.ts`.
    *   Added npm script for `addMusicEntertainmentApps.ts`.

# Progress: VibeFlow

## Current Status: Strategic Shift to "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool" - Memory Bank Updated, UI Text Updated. Ready for Real Authentication.

### What Works (Implemented & Documented)
*   **Strategic Product Direction Defined:** VibeFlow is now an "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool." Core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, this file) reflect this new direction.
*   **UI Updated for New Direction:** `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx` updated with introductory text explaining the new focus.
*   **Frontend Project Setup (Vite + React + TypeScript):** `vibeflow-frontend` directory created and configured.
*   **Basic Routing:** Implemented using `react-router-dom` for `/login`, `/signup`, and `/` (main app).
*   **Real Authentication with Firebase (Google Cloud Identity Platform):**
    *   Firebase SDK installed and configured in `firebaseConfig.ts`.
    *   `AuthContext.tsx` rewritten to use Firebase for sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and session management (`onAuthStateChanged`).
    *   `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` updated for Firebase integration, including improved error handling and navigation.
    *   `App.tsx` updated to handle Firebase auth loading state.
    *   Simulated authentication flow has been replaced.
*   **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Installed and configured.
*   **Comprehensive UI Styling:**
    *   Styled `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` with Tailwind CSS (larger forms, rounded corners).
    *   Styled `Layout.tsx` (header, navigation, footer).
    *   Styled `MainAppPage.tsx` (main input area).
    *   Brand colors (`brand-primary`: Indigo, `brand-secondary`: Pink) confirmed in `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   `.gitignore` created at project root to exclude `Google/` and other specified items.
    *   Project initialized as a Git repository.
    *   All project files successfully pushed to the new remote `https://github.com/Magneosolutions/vibeflow` (resolved unrelated histories).
*   **Cloud Run CI/CD Configuration & Deployment (`vibeflow-frontend`):**
    *   Dockerfile updated to use an entrypoint script and install `envsubst`.
    *   Nginx configuration (`nginx.conf.template`) modified to use `${PORT}`.
    *   `entrypoint.sh` created to substitute `$PORT`, test Nginx config, and start Nginx.
    *   Successfully troubleshot initial Nginx exit issue by enhancing `entrypoint.sh` logging.
    *   Successfully resolved "403 Forbidden" access issue by:
        *   As administrator, overriding the "Domain Restricted Sharing" organization policy for the project to "Allow all".
        *   Granting `Cloud Run Invoker` role to `allUsers` for the `vibeflow` service.
    *   The `vibeflow-frontend` application is now live and publicly accessible via Cloud Run.
    *   All related changes pushed to GitHub.
*   **UI Update for `Layout.tsx` (Resolved):**
    *   New vibrant design for `Layout.tsx` and animation definitions in `tailwind.config.js` were implemented and pushed.
    *   TypeScript errors related to `<style jsx>` were resolved by moving animations to Tailwind config and reinstalling dependencies.
    *   Cloud Build and Cloud Run deployments were successful.
    *   **Resolution:** The new Tailwind CSS styles and animations for `Layout.tsx` are now correctly applying in the deployed Cloud Run environment.
*   **Memory Bank Overhaul for Strategic Shift:** All core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) and `.clinerules` are now updated to reflect the new product direction, UI changes, and revised MVP.
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md` and updated to match the diagram in `systemPatterns.md`. This is the current source of truth for system flow.
*   **Initial Dataset Curation (MongoDB):**
    *   Defined schema for `datasets` collection.
    *   Successfully curated and inserted the first dataset ("Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)") into the `vibeflow_db.datasets` collection in MongoDB via VS Code playground.
*   **Navigation Fixes:** Ensured `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` correctly navigate to the main app after successful authentication.
*   **Backend Project Setup (Node.js/Express with TypeScript):**
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend` directory.
    *   Initialized `npm` and installed core dependencies (Express, MongoDB driver, Gemini SDK, dotenv, cors) and dev dependencies (TypeScript, ts-node, nodemon, types).
    *   Configured `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Established basic project structure (`src` with `index.ts`, `routes`, `services`, `config` subdirectories).
    *   Created `.gitignore` and a template `.env` file (populated by user).
    *   Implemented a basic Express server in `src/index.ts`.
    *   Added `build`, `start`, `dev` scripts to `package.json`.
*   **Backend Services & API Endpoint (Initial Implementation & Vector Search):**
    *   `mongoService.ts`: Implemented MongoDB connection logic and integrated into server startup.
    *   `aiService.ts`: Implemented Gemini connection and `getTextEmbedding` function (using "embedding-001" model).
    *   `vibeRoutes.ts`: Created `/api/process-vibe` POST endpoint. Initially used simulated search, now **updated with real `$vectorSearch` aggregation for datasets.**
    *   `index.ts`: Integrated `vibeRoutes` and a global error handler.
*   **Frontend-Backend Connection:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx`: "Flow" button now calls the `/api/process-vibe` backend endpoint and displays loading/results/errors.
*   **UI Branding Update:**
    *   Updated `index.html` favicon and title to use VibeFlow branding.
    *   Added `VibeFlow.png` logo prominently to `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `MainAppPage.tsx`.
*   **Real Vector Search for Datasets Implemented & Tested:**
    *   Created and successfully ran `populateGoogleTrendsEmbedding.ts` script to add vector embedding to the "Google Trends" dataset in MongoDB.
    *   Successfully created the `vector_index_datasets_description` Atlas Vector Search index on `datasets.description_embedding`.
    *   Updated `vibeRoutes.ts` to use the real `$vectorSearch` aggregation.
    *   End-to-end testing confirmed that vibe input on the frontend correctly retrieves the "Google Trends" dataset via vector search, **now displaying the relevance score and sample data snippet.**
*   **Frontend Enhanced for Dataset Results:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to display `score` and `sample_data_snippet` from backend results.
*   **Curated "App Ideas & Features" Dataset for Playground:**
    *   Defined, scripted, and successfully inserted 3 sample "App Ideas & Features" documents (with embeddings) into the `datasets` collection.
    *   Confirmed these new app ideas are discoverable via vector search and display correctly on the frontend.
*   **Frontend: Added "Try in Playground" Button UI:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to display a "Try in Playground" button for datasets categorized as "Playground App Idea".
    *   Corrected `vibeRoutes.ts` to ensure the `category` field is projected to the frontend.
*   **Implemented Full Dataset Playground Functionality (End-to-End):**
    *   **AI Service:** `aiService.ts` enhanced with `generateSampleMongoQueries` to get query suggestions from an LLM.
    *   **Backend Routes:** New `playgroundRoutes.ts` created and integrated, providing endpoints to generate sample queries and execute them.
    *   **Frontend Logic:** `MainAppPage.tsx` fully updated to manage the playground flow: fetching sample queries, displaying them, allowing user selection, sending the chosen query for execution, and displaying the results.
    *   This entire interactive loop is tested and working.

### What's Left to Build (Phase 1 - MVP - Revised for Interactive Refinement & Learning)
*   **Thoroughly Test Real Authentication:** (User confirmed auth works).
*   **Continue Curating Other Resources (APIs, more Datasets):**
    *   Define schema for `apis` collection in MongoDB.
    *   Manually curate 5-10 common APIs (metadata, sample data snippets, vector embeddings).
    *   Generate embeddings and update/create search indexes for APIs.
    *   Curate additional diverse public datasets if desired.
*   **Core "Vibe" Interaction (Backend):**
    *   **Frontend:** Connect "Try in Playground" button to fetch/display sample queries, and then execute a selected query and display its results.

    *   Implement MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to match a vibe to datasets and APIs.
    *   Develop backend endpoints to serve these suggestions.
    *   Develop frontend components to display suggested datasets and APIs.
*   **Basic AI "Vibe Check" (Backend & Frontend):**
    *   Implement a simple AI-driven feedback mechanism (e.g., on scope, common considerations).
    *   Display this feedback on the frontend.
*   **Curated Learning Links (Static Initial Set - Frontend):**
    *   Display a small, static set of general learning links relevant to app development.
*   **Focus:** Make the "Vibe Input -> AI Analysis -> MongoDB Search -> Display Suggested Datasets/APIs + Basic AI Feedback" loop functional.

### Known Issues & Blockers
*   **Backend Tech Stack Decision:** Resolved (Node.js/Express with TypeScript).
*   **AI Model Selection & Access:** Google Gemini selected. API key in `.env`. `aiService.ts` initializes client and `getTextEmbedding` is implemented. `getAIFeedback` is a placeholder.
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md` Naming:** Resolved.

### Overall Project Health
*   **Green:** Major milestone achieved! Real vector search for datasets is implemented and working end-to-end. The "Google Trends" dataset is embedded, indexed, and successfully retrieved via semantic search from the frontend. Authentication is working. Backend server is stable. Next steps involve expanding curated content and implementing AI feedback.

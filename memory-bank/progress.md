# Progress: VibeFlow

## Current Status: UI Styling & Frontend Foundation (Phase 1 Pre-work)

### What Works (Implemented & Documented)
*   **Frontend Project Setup (Vite + React + TypeScript):** `vibeflow-frontend` directory created and configured.
*   **Basic Routing:** Implemented using `react-router-dom` for `/login`, `/signup`, and `/` (main app).
*   **Simulated Authentication Flow:**
    *   `AuthContext.tsx` created to manage simulated auth state.
    *   `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `Layout.tsx` use this context.
    *   Demo credentials (`demo@example.com` / `password123`) allow "login/signup".
    *   Protected route for the main application page.
*   **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Installed and configured.
*   **Initial UI Styling (Login & Sign Up Pages):**
    *   Styled `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` with Tailwind CSS.
    *   Form containers are larger (`sm:max-w-lg`).
    *   Card corners are more rounded (`sm:rounded-2xl`).
*   **Memory Bank:** All core files created and updated to reflect current project state, including technology choices (React, GCIP for auth) and UI progress.

### What's Left to Build (Immediate Next Steps - UI Styling & Refinement)
1.  **Style `Layout.tsx`:** Apply Tailwind CSS to the header, navigation links, and sign-out button for a consistent look.
2.  **Style `MainAppPage.tsx`:** Apply Tailwind CSS to the main content area, text input, and "Flow" button.
3.  **Color Scheme & Branding:** Review and refine `brand-primary` and `brand-secondary` colors in `tailwind.config.js` if needed.
4.  **Further UI Polish:** Address any minor visual inconsistencies or improvements.

### What's Left to Build (Phase 1 - MVP - High-Level, re-prioritized)
*   **Real Authentication Implementation:** Integrate Google Cloud Identity Platform, replacing the simulated flow.
*   **Dataset Curation & Storage:**
    *   Manually curate 20-30 public datasets.
    *   Store them in MongoDB Atlas (define schema, populate).
*   **Core "Vibe" Input & AI Analysis:**
    *   Build frontend for "Vibe" text input.
    *   Integrate AI (e.g., Gemini) for text analysis and vector embedding generation.
*   **MongoDB Vector Search Implementation:**
    *   Set up MongoDB Atlas for Vector Search.
    *   Implement backend logic to query datasets based on vibe embedding.
*   **Basic Output:**
    *   Provide a link to a single, hard-coded boilerplate GitHub project (no code generation yet).
*   **End-to-End Flow:** Ensure the "MongoDB Search -> Suggested Dataset (link)" flow is functional.

### Known Issues & Blockers
*   **Clarification on "AudioFlowDiagram.md":** The existing `AudioFlowDiagram.md` is considered sufficient.
*   **Tech Stack Decisions:**
    *   Frontend: **React** (Confirmed & Implemented)
    *   Authentication: **Google Cloud Identity Platform** (Confirmed, simulated on frontend)
    *   Backend: Decision pending (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI).
*   **AI Model Selection & Access:** Decision pending for AI model (e.g., Google Gemini).

### Overall Project Health
*   **Green:** Frontend foundation with simulated authentication and initial styling is in place. Memory Bank is up-to-date. Next steps are to complete UI styling and then move to real authentication.

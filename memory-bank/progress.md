# Progress: VibeFlow

## Current Status: Strategic Shift to "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool" - Memory Bank Updated, UI Text Updated. Ready for Real Authentication.

### What Works (Implemented & Documented)
*   **Strategic Product Direction Defined:** VibeFlow is now an "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool." Core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, this file) reflect this new direction.
*   **UI Updated for New Direction:** `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx` updated with introductory text explaining the new focus.
*   **Frontend Project Setup (Vite + React + TypeScript):** `vibeflow-frontend` directory created and configured.
*   **Basic Routing:** Implemented using `react-router-dom` for `/login`, `/signup`, and `/` (main app).
*   **Real Authentication with Firebase (Google Cloud Identity Platform):**
    *   Firebase SDK installed and configured in `firebaseConfig.ts`.
    *   `AuthContext.tsx` rewritten to use Firebase for sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and session management (`onAuthStateChanged`).
    *   `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` updated for Firebase integration, including improved error handling and navigation.
    *   `App.tsx` updated to handle Firebase auth loading state.
    *   Simulated authentication flow has been replaced.
*   **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Installed and configured.
*   **Comprehensive UI Styling:**
    *   Styled `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` with Tailwind CSS (larger forms, rounded corners).
    *   Styled `Layout.tsx` (header, navigation, footer).
    *   Styled `MainAppPage.tsx` (main input area).
    *   Brand colors (`brand-primary`: Indigo, `brand-secondary`: Pink) confirmed in `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   `.gitignore` created at project root to exclude `Google/` and other specified items.
    *   Project initialized as a Git repository.
    *   All project files successfully pushed to the new remote `https://github.com/Magneosolutions/vibeflow` (resolved unrelated histories).
*   **Cloud Run CI/CD Configuration & Deployment (`vibeflow-frontend`):**
    *   Dockerfile updated to use an entrypoint script and install `envsubst`.
    *   Nginx configuration (`nginx.conf.template`) modified to use `${PORT}`.
    *   `entrypoint.sh` created to substitute `$PORT`, test Nginx config, and start Nginx.
    *   Successfully troubleshot initial Nginx exit issue by enhancing `entrypoint.sh` logging.
    *   Successfully resolved "403 Forbidden" access issue by:
        *   As administrator, overriding the "Domain Restricted Sharing" organization policy for the project to "Allow all".
        *   Granting `Cloud Run Invoker` role to `allUsers` for the `vibeflow` service.
    *   The `vibeflow-frontend` application is now live and publicly accessible via Cloud Run.
    *   All related changes pushed to GitHub.
*   **UI Update for `Layout.tsx` (Resolved):**
    *   New vibrant design for `Layout.tsx` and animation definitions in `tailwind.config.js` were implemented and pushed.
    *   TypeScript errors related to `<style jsx>` were resolved by moving animations to Tailwind config and reinstalling dependencies.
    *   Cloud Build and Cloud Run deployments were successful.
    *   **Resolution:** The new Tailwind CSS styles and animations for `Layout.tsx` are now correctly applying in the deployed Cloud Run environment.
*   **Memory Bank Overhaul for Strategic Shift:** All core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) and `.clinerules` are now updated to reflect the new product direction, UI changes, and revised MVP.
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md` and updated to match the diagram in `systemPatterns.md`. This is the current source of truth for system flow.
*   **Initial Dataset Curation (MongoDB):**
    *   Defined schema for `datasets` collection.
    *   Successfully curated and inserted the first dataset ("Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)") into the `vibeflow_db.datasets` collection in MongoDB via VS Code playground.
*   **Navigation Fixes:** Ensured `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` correctly navigate to the main app after successful authentication.
*   **Backend Project Setup (Node.js/Express with TypeScript):**
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend` directory.
    *   Initialized `npm` and installed core dependencies (Express, MongoDB driver, Gemini SDK, dotenv, cors) and dev dependencies (TypeScript, ts-node, nodemon, types).
    *   Configured `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Established basic project structure (`src` with `index.ts`, `routes`, `services`, `config` subdirectories).
    *   Created `.gitignore` and a template `.env` file (populated by user).
    *   Implemented a basic Express server in `src/index.ts`.
    *   Added `build`, `start`, `dev` scripts to `package.json`.
*   **Backend Services & API Endpoint (Initial Implementation & Vector Search):**
    *   `mongoService.ts`: Implemented MongoDB connection logic and integrated into server startup.
    *   `aiService.ts`: Implemented Gemini connection and `getTextEmbedding` function (using "embedding-001" model).
    *   `vibeRoutes.ts`: Created `/api/process-vibe` POST endpoint. Initially used simulated search, now **updated with real `$vectorSearch` aggregation for datasets.**
    *   `index.ts`: Integrated `vibeRoutes` and a global error handler.
*   **Frontend-Backend Connection:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx`: "Flow" button now calls the `/api/process-vibe` backend endpoint and displays loading/results/errors.
*   **UI Branding Update:**
    *   Updated `index.html` favicon and title to use VibeFlow branding.
    *   Added `VibeFlow.png` logo prominently to `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `MainAppPage.tsx`.
*   **Real Vector Search for Datasets Implemented & Tested:**
    *   Created and successfully ran `populateGoogleTrendsEmbedding.ts` script to add vector embedding to the "Google Trends" dataset in MongoDB.
    *   Successfully created the `vector_index_datasets_description` Atlas Vector Search index on `datasets.description_embedding`.
    *   Updated `vibeRoutes.ts` to use the real `$vectorSearch` aggregation.
    *   End-to-end testing confirmed that vibe input on the frontend correctly retrieves the "Google Trends" dataset via vector search, **now displaying the relevance score and sample data snippet.**
*   **Frontend Enhanced for Dataset Results:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to display `score` and `sample_data_snippet` from backend results.
*   **Curated "App Ideas & Features" Dataset for Playground:**
    *   Defined, scripted, and successfully inserted 3 sample "App Ideas & Features" documents (with embeddings) into the `datasets` collection.
    *   Confirmed these new app ideas are discoverable via vector search and display correctly on the frontend.
*   **Frontend: Added "Try in Playground" Button UI:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to display a "Try in Playground" button for datasets categorized as "Playground App Idea".
    *   Corrected `vibeRoutes.ts` to ensure the `category` field is projected to the frontend.
*   **Implemented Full Dataset Playground Functionality (End-to-End):**
    *   **AI Service:** `aiService.ts` enhanced with `generateSampleMongoQueries` to get query suggestions from an LLM.
    *   **Backend Routes:** New `playgroundRoutes.ts` created and integrated, providing endpoints to generate sample queries and execute them.
    *   **Frontend Logic:** `MainAppPage.tsx` fully updated to manage the playground flow: fetching sample queries, displaying them, allowing user selection, sending the chosen query for execution, and displaying the results.
    *   This entire interactive loop is tested and working.
*   **Refined AI Feedback (Vibe Check):**
    *   `aiService.ts` updated with a more structured prompt for `getAIFeedback` to include "Refine Your Vision" and "Learn As You Go" sections, tailored to the user's vibe and the single matched dataset.
    *   `vibeRoutes.ts` updated to limit search results to 1 and pass the matched dataset details to `getAIFeedback`.
    *   Frontend now displays this more focused and structured AI feedback.
    *   (Frontend markdown rendering for AI feedback was initiated, `@tailwindcss/typography` installation was interrupted).
*   **Frontend Formatting for AI Feedback:**
    *   `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin installed and configured in `tailwind.config.js`.
    *   Markdown rendering (bolding, lists) for AI feedback verified by user on 2025-06-14.
*   **README.md Updated:** Project description in root `README.md` updated on 2025-06-14.
*   **UI Tweak (Header Subtitle):** Updated "Vibe Coders Assistant" to "Vibecoder Assistant" in `Layout.tsx` (2025-06-14).
*   **Mobile API Fetching Setup:**
    *   Updated `MainAppPage.tsx` to use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for API calls.
    *   Created `vibeflow-frontend/.env` with placeholder for `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
    *   User instructed on how to find local IP, update `.env`, and restart Vite with `--host` for mobile testing. (2025-06-15).
*   **Backend Deployment Preparation (Dockerfile):**
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/Dockerfile` to containerize the backend application. (2025-06-15).
    *   Verified that the backend's port configuration in `src/config/index.ts` correctly uses `process.env.PORT || '3001'`, suitable for Cloud Run. (2025-06-15).
*   **Backend Ready for User Deployment:** The `vibeflow-backend` is fully prepared for the user to build, push to a container registry, and deploy to Google Cloud Run.
*   **`vibeflow-backend` Deployed to Cloud Run:** Successfully deployed to `https://vibeflow-backend-679820915121.us-west2.run.app/api` and confirmed operational.
*   **Frontend Deployment Configuration Fixed:** Cloud Build trigger for `vibeflow-frontend` updated with correct `_VITE_API_BASE_URL` (including `/api` path). Frontend redeployed.
*   **Application Working on Desktop:** VibeFlow is now functional end-to-end on desktop browsers.
*   **Mobile Connection Issue Narrowed Down:**
    *   Application shows "failed to load" on iPhone Chrome when "Flow" button is clicked (API call to `/api/process-vibe`).
    *   Direct access to the backend root URL (`https://vibeflow-backend-679820915121.us-west2.run.app/`) *works* on iPhone Chrome.
    *   This suggests the issue is specific to the frontend's API request from mobile, not general backend unreachability from the phone.

### What's Left to Build (Phase 1 - MVP - Revised for Interactive Refinement & Learning)
*   **Troubleshoot Mobile API Call Issue:**
    *   Attempt to get detailed console/network logs from iPhone Chrome during the failed API call.
    *   Investigate potential CORS nuances, Content Security Policy (CSP), or mobile browser-specific `fetch` behavior.
*   **Enable API Search in Backend:**
    *   Modify `vibeRoutes.ts` to search the `apis` collection (once populated) in addition to `datasets`.
    *   Update frontend to display suggested APIs.
*   **Resolve `populateApiData.ts` TypeScript Error:**
    *   User to investigate and fix the persistent TS2345 error in `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/populateApiData.ts`.
    *   Run the script to populate the `apis` collection in MongoDB.
*   **Create Atlas Vector Search Index for APIs:**
    *   Once APIs are populated, create a vector search index in MongoDB Atlas for the `apis.description_embedding` field.
*   **Continue Curating Other Resources (APIs, more Datasets):**
    *   Define schema for `apis` collection in MongoDB. (Completed 2025-06-14, documented in `systemPatterns.md`).
    *   Manually curate a small list (e.g., 5-10) of common APIs with metadata, sample data snippets, and vector embeddings.
        *   Created `vibeflow-backend/src/scripts/populateApiData.ts` with 2 initial APIs.
        *   Added `populate:apis` script to `vibeflow-backend/package.json`.
    *   Generate embeddings for these APIs and update/create necessary Atlas Vector Search indexes.
        *   **Issue:** Execution of `populateApiData.ts` script is blocked by a persistent TypeScript error (TS2345) related to type inference for `api.description`. User to investigate TS/ts-node environment or run script with type error ignored.
    *   Consider adding 1-2 more diverse public datasets if beneficial for the POC.
*   **Display Curated Learning Links (Static Initial Set - Frontend):**
    *   Added a dedicated section to `MainAppPage.tsx` to display a static set of general learning resource links (React, MongoDB Atlas, Tailwind CSS, Node.js). (Completed 2025-06-14).
*   **Review and Refine Overall UX/UI:**
    *   Consider any minor UI tweaks for clarity or improved user flow based on current features.

### Known Issues & Blockers
*   **TypeScript Error in `populateApiData.ts`:** Persistent TS2345 error blocks populating the `apis` collection. (Note: This was resolved locally before the successful build and deployment, but keeping the note until script is run successfully).

### Overall Project Health
*   **Excellent (Green):** VibeFlow is now fully deployed and operational on Google Cloud Run. The frontend and backend are communicating successfully. Core functionality is in place. The primary next steps involve expanding the curated content (APIs, datasets) and resolving any remaining issues with data population scripts.

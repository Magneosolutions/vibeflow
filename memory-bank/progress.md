# Progress: VibeFlow

## Current Status: API Resource Discovery Feature successfully implemented and verified end-to-end.

### What Works (Implemented & Documented)
*   **UI Disclaimers for Data Limitations:**
    *   Added a disclaimer to `MainAppPage.tsx` about VibeFlow being a proof-of-concept with a growing curated resource collection. (2025-06-15)
    *   Added a new Q&A item to `FAQPage.tsx` explaining the limited dataset size and proof-of-concept status. (2025-06-15)
*   **Expanded API/Resource Curation:** Successfully added "Awesome Public Datasets (GitHub)" to the `apis` collection via the `populateApiData.ts` script, and user confirmed it's discoverable in the UI. (2025-06-15)
*   **End-to-End API Resource Discovery:**
    *   `apis` collection populated in MongoDB with embeddings via `populateApiData.ts` script.
    *   Atlas Vector Search index `vector_index_apis_description` confirmed active and correctly configured.
    *   Backend (`vibeRoutes.ts`) successfully searches `apis` collection and includes `apiResults` in the response (verified after backend redeployment).
    *   Frontend (`MainAppPage.tsx`) correctly displays "Suggested APIs" with details.
*   **API Data Population Script (`populateApiData.ts`):** Successfully created and executed, populating the `apis` collection in MongoDB with 2 initial APIs and their embeddings. TypeScript error previously blocking this script has been resolved.
*   **Atlas Vector Search Index for APIs (`vector_index_apis_description`):** Confirmed by user to be correctly configured (name: `vector_index_apis_description`, field: `description_embedding`, dimensions: 768) and 'READY' (active) in MongoDB Atlas.
*   **Backend API Endpoint Code (`/api/process-vibe` in `vibeRoutes.ts`):** Deployed version now correctly searches both datasets and APIs, and includes `apiResults` in the JSON response.
*   **Frontend Display Logic for APIs (`MainAppPage.tsx`):** Verified to correctly render 'Suggested APIs' when data is provided by the backend.
*   **Strategic Product Direction Defined:** VibeFlow is now an "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool." Core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, this file) reflect this new direction.
*   **Strategic Product Direction Defined:** VibeFlow is now an "Interactive Vibe Refinement & Learning Tool." Core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, this file) reflect this new direction.
*   **UI Updated for New Direction:** `vibeflow-frontend/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx` updated with introductory text explaining the new focus.
*   **Frontend Project Setup (Vite + React + TypeScript):** `vibeflow-frontend` directory created and configured.
*   **Basic Routing:** Implemented using `react-router-dom` for `/login`, `/signup`, and `/` (main app).
*   **Real Authentication with Firebase (Google Cloud Identity Platform):**
    *   Firebase SDK installed and configured in `firebaseConfig.ts`.
    *   `AuthContext.tsx` rewritten to use Firebase for sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and session management (`onAuthStateChanged`).
    *   `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` updated for Firebase integration, including improved error handling and navigation.
    *   `App.tsx` updated to handle Firebase auth loading state.
    *   Simulated authentication flow has been replaced.
*   **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Installed and configured.
*   **Comprehensive UI Styling:**
    *   Styled `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` with Tailwind CSS (larger forms, rounded corners).
    *   Styled `Layout.tsx` (header, navigation, footer).
    *   Styled `MainAppPage.tsx` (main input area).
    *   Brand colors (`brand-primary`: Indigo, `brand-secondary`: Pink) confirmed in `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   `.gitignore` created at project root to exclude `Google/` and other specified items.
    *   Project initialized as a Git repository.
    *   All project files successfully pushed to the new remote `https://github.com/Magneosolutions/vibeflow` (resolved unrelated histories).
*   **Cloud Run CI/CD Configuration & Deployment (`vibeflow-frontend`):**
    *   Dockerfile updated to use an entrypoint script and install `envsubst`.
    *   Nginx configuration (`nginx.conf.template`) modified to use `${PORT}`.
    *   `entrypoint.sh` created to substitute `$PORT`, test Nginx config, and start Nginx.
    *   Successfully troubleshot initial Nginx exit issue by enhancing `entrypoint.sh` logging.
    *   Successfully resolved "403 Forbidden" access issue by:
        *   As administrator, overriding the "Domain Restricted Sharing" organization policy for the project to "Allow all".
        *   Granting `Cloud Run Invoker` role to `allUsers` for the `vibeflow` service.
    *   The `vibeflow-frontend` application is now live and publicly accessible via Cloud Run.
    *   All related changes pushed to GitHub.
*   **UI Update for `Layout.tsx` (Resolved):**
    *   New vibrant design for `Layout.tsx` and animation definitions in `tailwind.config.js` were implemented and pushed.
    *   TypeScript errors related to `<style jsx>` were resolved by moving animations to Tailwind config and reinstalling dependencies.
    *   Cloud Build and Cloud Run deployments were successful.
    *   **Resolution:** The new Tailwind CSS styles and animations for `Layout.tsx` are now correctly applying in the deployed Cloud Run environment.
*   **Memory Bank Overhaul for Strategic Shift:** All core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) and `.clinerules` are now updated to reflect the new product direction, UI changes, and revised MVP.
*   **`SystemDataFlowDiagram.md`:** Renamed from `AudioFlowDiagram.md` and updated to match the diagram in `systemPatterns.md`. This is the current source of truth for system flow.
*   **Initial Dataset Curation (MongoDB):**
    *   Defined schema for `datasets` collection.
    *   Successfully curated and inserted the first dataset ("Google Trends - Daily Top Rising Terms (US)") into the `vibeflow_db.datasets` collection in MongoDB via VS Code playground.
*   **Navigation Fixes:** Ensured `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` correctly navigate to the main app after successful authentication.
*   **Backend Project Setup (Node.js/Express with TypeScript):**
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend` directory.
    *   Initialized `npm` and installed core dependencies (Express, MongoDB driver, Gemini SDK, dotenv, cors) and dev dependencies (TypeScript, ts-node, nodemon, types).
    *   Configured `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Established basic project structure (`src` with `index.ts`, `routes`, `services`, `config` subdirectories).
    *   Created `.gitignore` and a template `.env` file (populated by user).
    *   Implemented a basic Express server in `src/index.ts`.
    *   Added `build`, `start`, `dev` scripts to `package.json`.
*   **Backend Services & API Endpoint (Initial Implementation & Vector Search):**
    *   `mongoService.ts`: Implemented MongoDB connection logic and integrated into server startup.
    *   `aiService.ts`: Implemented Gemini connection and `getTextEmbedding` function (using "embedding-001" model).
    *   `vibeRoutes.ts`: Created `/api/process-vibe` POST endpoint. Initially used simulated search, now **updated with real `$vectorSearch` aggregation for datasets.**
    *   `index.ts`: Integrated `vibeRoutes` and a global error handler.
*   **Frontend-Backend Connection:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx`: "Flow" button now calls the `/api/process-vibe` backend endpoint and displays loading/results/errors.
*   **UI Branding Update:**
    *   Updated `index.html` favicon and title to use VibeFlow branding.
    *   Added `VibeFlow.png` logo prominently to `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `MainAppPage.tsx`.
*   **Real Vector Search for Datasets Implemented & Tested:**
    *   Created and successfully ran `populateGoogleTrendsEmbedding.ts` script to add vector embedding to the "Google Trends" dataset in MongoDB.
    *   Successfully created the `vector_index_datasets_description` Atlas Vector Search index on `datasets.description_embedding`.
    *   Updated `vibeRoutes.ts` to use the real `$vectorSearch` aggregation.
    *   End-to-end testing confirmed that vibe input on the frontend correctly retrieves the "Google Trends" dataset via vector search, **now displaying the relevance score and sample data snippet.**
*   **Frontend Enhanced for Dataset Results:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to display `score` and `sample_data_snippet` from backend results.
*   **Curated "App Ideas & Features" Dataset for Playground:**
    *   Defined, scripted, and successfully inserted 3 sample "App Ideas & Features" documents (with embeddings) into the `datasets` collection.
    *   Confirmed these new app ideas are discoverable via vector search and display correctly on the frontend.
*   **Frontend: Added "Try in Playground" Button UI:**
    *   `MainAppPage.tsx` updated to display a "Try in Playground" button for datasets categorized as "Playground App Idea".
    *   Corrected `vibeRoutes.ts` to ensure the `category` field is projected to the frontend.
*   **Implemented Full Dataset Playground Functionality (End-to-End):**
    *   **AI Service:** `aiService.ts` enhanced with `generateSampleMongoQueries` to get query suggestions from an LLM.
    *   **Backend Routes:** New `playgroundRoutes.ts` created and integrated, providing endpoints to generate sample queries and execute them.
    *   **Frontend Logic:** `MainAppPage.tsx` fully updated to manage the playground flow: fetching sample queries, displaying them, allowing user selection, sending the chosen query for execution, and displaying the results.
    *   This entire interactive loop is tested and working.
*   **Refined AI Feedback (Vibe Check):**
    *   `aiService.ts` updated with a more structured prompt for `getAIFeedback` to include "Refine Your Vision" and "Learn As You Go" sections, tailored to the user's vibe and the single matched dataset.
    *   `vibeRoutes.ts` updated to limit search results to 1 and pass the matched dataset details to `getAIFeedback`.
    *   Frontend now displays this more focused and structured AI feedback.
    *   (Frontend markdown rendering for AI feedback was initiated, `@tailwindcss/typography` installation was interrupted).
*   **Frontend Formatting for AI Feedback:**
    *   `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin installed and configured in `tailwind.config.js`.
    *   Markdown rendering (bolding, lists) for AI feedback verified by user on 2025-06-14.
*   **README.md Updated:** Project description in root `README.md` updated on 2025-06-14.
*   **UI Tweak (Header Subtitle):** Updated "Vibe Coders Assistant" to "Vibecoder Assistant" in `Layout.tsx` (2025-06-14).
*   **Mobile API Fetching Setup:**
    *   Updated `MainAppPage.tsx` to use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for API calls.
    *   Created `vibeflow-frontend/.env` with placeholder for `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
    *   User instructed on how to find local IP, update `.env`, and restart Vite with `--host` for mobile testing. (2025-06-15).
*   **Backend Deployment Preparation (Dockerfile):**
    *   Created `vibeflow-backend/Dockerfile` to containerize the backend application. (2025-06-15).
    *   Verified that the backend's port configuration in `src/config/index.ts` correctly uses `process.env.PORT || '3001'`, suitable for Cloud Run. (2025-06-15).
*   **Backend Ready for User Deployment:** The `vibeflow-backend` is fully prepared for the user to build, push to a container registry, and deploy to Google Cloud Run.
*   **`vibeflow-backend` Deployed to Cloud Run:** Successfully deployed to `https://vibeflow-backend-679820915121.us-west2.run.app/api` and confirmed operational.
*   **Frontend Deployment Configuration Fixed:** Cloud Build trigger for `vibeflow-frontend` updated with correct `_VITE_API_BASE_URL` (including `/api` path). Frontend redeployed.
*   **Application Working on Desktop:** VibeFlow is now functional end-to-end on desktop browsers.
*   **Mobile Connection Issue Narrowed Down:** (Status unchanged, pending further investigation after core API feature works)
    *   Application shows "failed to load" on iPhone Chrome when "Flow" button is clicked (API call to `/api/process-vibe`).
    *   Direct access to the backend root URL (`https://vibeflow-backend-679820915121.us-west2.run.app/`) *works* on iPhone Chrome.
    *   This suggests the issue is specific to the frontend's API request from mobile, not general backend unreachability from the phone.

### What's Left to Build (Phase 1 - MVP - Revised for Interactive Refinement & Learning)
*   **Troubleshoot Frontend Login/Navigation Issue:**
    *   Investigate and fix the issue where the link from the sign-up page (`SignUpPage.tsx`) to the login page (`LoginPage.tsx`) was not working correctly. This was deferred during API testing.
*   **Troubleshoot Mobile API Call Issue:**
    *   Investigate why API calls from mobile browsers might be failing, even if the backend is reachable directly from the mobile browser. Consider CORS, CSP, or specific mobile `fetch` behaviors.
*   **Continue Curating API Resources:**
    *   Now that API search and display are functional, expand the `apis` collection in MongoDB with more diverse and relevant APIs.
    *   Run `populateApiData.ts` (or an enhanced version) to add new APIs and their embeddings.
*   **Review and Refine Overall UX/UI:**
    *   Consider any minor UI tweaks for clarity or improved user flow based on current features, including the display of API results.
*   **Commit Memory Bank Updates to Version Control:**
    *   The current updates to `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `techContext.md` need to be committed and pushed. (This was completed for API feature verification and "Awesome Public Datasets" addition. A new commit will be needed for the build fix and these current memory bank updates).
*   **Deploy Frontend Changes:** The UI disclaimer updates in `MainAppPage.tsx` and `FAQPage.tsx` need to be deployed to Cloud Run to be live.

### Known Issues & Blockers
*   **(Resolved) Frontend Build Failure:** A syntax error in `vibeflow-frontend/src/firebaseConfig.ts` (related to `apiKey`) caused CI/CD builds to fail. This was corrected, and a subsequent build was successful.
*   **(Resolved) API Suggestions Not Appearing in Frontend:** This issue was due to an outdated backend deployment. Resolved by user redeploying `vibeflow-backend` with the latest code. `apiResults` are now correctly returned by the backend and displayed by the frontend.
*   **Frontend Login/Navigation Issue (Deferred):** Link from sign-up to login page was observed to be non-functional.
*   **Mobile API Call Issue (Pending Investigation):** API calls from mobile browsers may be failing.

### Overall Project Health
*   **Excellent (Green):** Core functionality for dataset discovery, API resource discovery, and the dataset playground is now operational on deployed environments. The VibeFlow application is successfully demonstrating its key Phase 1 MVP features. Remaining tasks involve addressing minor UI/navigation issues, mobile compatibility, and expanding curated content.

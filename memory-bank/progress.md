# Progress: VibeFlow

## Current Status: Core UI Styling Complete, Frontend Foundation Stable, Ready for Authentication

### What Works (Implemented & Documented)
*   **Frontend Project Setup (Vite + React + TypeScript):** `vibeflow-frontend` directory created and configured.
*   **Basic Routing:** Implemented using `react-router-dom` for `/login`, `/signup`, and `/` (main app).
*   **Simulated Authentication Flow:**
    *   `AuthContext.tsx` created to manage simulated auth state.
    *   `LoginPage.tsx`, `SignUpPage.tsx`, and `Layout.tsx` use this context.
    *   Demo credentials (`demo@example.com` / `password123`) allow "login/signup".
    *   Protected route for the main application page.
*   **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Installed and configured.
*   **Comprehensive UI Styling:**
    *   Styled `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` with Tailwind CSS (larger forms, rounded corners).
    *   Styled `Layout.tsx` (header, navigation, footer).
    *   Styled `MainAppPage.tsx` (main input area).
    *   Brand colors (`brand-primary`: Indigo, `brand-secondary`: Pink) confirmed in `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   `.gitignore` created at project root to exclude `Google/` and other specified items.
    *   Project initialized as a Git repository.
    *   All project files successfully pushed to the new remote `https://github.com/Magneosolutions/vibeflow` (resolved unrelated histories).
*   **Cloud Run CI/CD Configuration & Deployment (`vibeflow-frontend`):**
    *   Dockerfile updated to use an entrypoint script and install `envsubst`.
    *   Nginx configuration (`nginx.conf.template`) modified to use `${PORT}`.
    *   `entrypoint.sh` created to substitute `$PORT`, test Nginx config, and start Nginx.
    *   Successfully troubleshot initial Nginx exit issue by enhancing `entrypoint.sh` logging.
    *   Successfully resolved "403 Forbidden" access issue by:
        *   As administrator, overriding the "Domain Restricted Sharing" organization policy for the project to "Allow all".
        *   Granting `Cloud Run Invoker` role to `allUsers` for the `vibeflow` service.
    *   The `vibeflow-frontend` application is now live and publicly accessible via Cloud Run.
    *   All related changes pushed to GitHub.
*   **UI Update for `Layout.tsx` (Resolved):**
    *   New vibrant design for `Layout.tsx` and animation definitions in `tailwind.config.js` were implemented and pushed.
    *   TypeScript errors related to `<style jsx>` were resolved by moving animations to Tailwind config and reinstalling dependencies.
    *   Cloud Build and Cloud Run deployments were successful.
    *   **Resolution:** The new Tailwind CSS styles and animations for `Layout.tsx` are now correctly applying in the deployed Cloud Run environment.
*   **Memory Bank:** All core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `AudioFlowDiagram.md`) and `.clinerules` are up-to-date with recent changes, including Cloud Run deployment patterns and troubleshooting.

### What's Left to Build (Phase 1 - MVP - High-Level)
*   **Real Authentication Implementation:** Integrate Google Cloud Identity Platform, replacing the simulated flow.
*   **Dataset Curation & Storage:**
    *   Manually curate 20-30 public datasets.
    *   Store them in MongoDB Atlas (define schema, populate).
*   **Core "Vibe" Input & AI Analysis:**
    *   Build frontend for "Vibe" text input.
    *   Integrate AI (e.g., Gemini) for text analysis and vector embedding generation.
*   **MongoDB Vector Search Implementation:**
    *   Set up MongoDB Atlas for Vector Search.
    *   Implement backend logic to query datasets based on vibe embedding.
*   **Basic Output:**
    *   Provide a link to a single, hard-coded boilerplate GitHub project (no code generation yet).
*   **End-to-End Flow:** Ensure the "MongoDB Search -> Suggested Dataset (link)" flow is functional.

### Known Issues & Blockers
*   **Clarification on "AudioFlowDiagram.md":** The existing `AudioFlowDiagram.md` is considered sufficient.
*   **Tech Stack Decisions:**
    *   Frontend: **React** (Confirmed & Implemented)
    *   Authentication: **Google Cloud Identity Platform** (Confirmed, simulated on frontend)
    *   Backend: Decision pending (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI).
*   **AI Model Selection & Access:** Decision pending for AI model (e.g., Google Gemini).

### Overall Project Health
*   **Green:** Core UI styling is complete, and the frontend foundation with simulated authentication is stable. The project is version controlled on GitHub. Memory Bank is fully updated. The next major step is implementing real authentication.
